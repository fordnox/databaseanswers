	<BR>[Toby] : I'm glad you like it, Dimple. What would you like to do today ?
<BR>[Dimple] : I'd like to visit Windsor Castle, because it's one of the most popular tourist attractions in England, and it's easy to get to from London.
<BR>[Toby] : OK. Let's go ...

[Dimple] Wow, Toby, there are so many Banks, Cafes, Pubs, Restaurants, Shops, Wine Bars and Hospitals !!!
<BR>[Toby] : Yes, let's start thinking about our Data Model. 
<BR>The other thing that we see when we look around is people - lots of people.

<B>5) STARTING OUR DATA MODEL :</B>
<BR><IMG ALT="People and Establishments" SRC="images/ip_people_and_establishments.gif">
<BR><BR>[Dimple] : How do we get started ?
<BR>[Toby] : Well, we know that we have People and Places.
<BR> The simplest start is to call all these places Establishments.
<BR>Then we simply have different kinds of Establishments.
<BR> And we have people - local people, visitors, people working here, people here on business and so on.
<BR><BR> [Dimple] : Hmmm - so how do we translate what we know to help us get started with our Data Model !!!

<B>6) IDENTIFIERS AND PRIMARY KEYS :</B>
<BR><IMG ALT="People and Establishments with Identifiers" WIDTH=300 SRC="images/ip_people_and_establishments_with_identifiers.gif">
<BR><BR>[Dimple] : Toby, I am one of these People so how I am I going to identify myself from everybody else.
<BR>[Toby] : We will give everybody a Unique Identifier and every Establishment its own unique Identifier. 
<BR>When we use these we call them <B>Primary Keys</B>, and show them in the diagram with a <B>PK</B> on the left-hand side.
<BR>[Dimple] : That sounds good, Toby, but I don't know what it means.
<BR>[Toby] : Well, Dimple, let's look at how we use these Identifiers ...

<BR>
<IMG ALT="People Establishments and Visits" WIiiiDTH=460 SRC="images/ip_people_establishments_and_visits.gif">
<BR>[Toby] : Dimple, now we can add some interesting details because we know that one person can visit many Establishments.
<BR>We also know that one Establishment is visited by many Visitors.
<BR>Then we call this a <B>Many-to-Many Relationship</B> between People and Establishments.
<!---
<BR><BR>To make it easier for you to understand I have expanded the <B>Many-to-Many Relationship</B> into two different things, which are called <B>One-to-Many Relationships</B>. 
<BR>[Dimple] : So Toby, is that like saying that One Person can make Many Visits to many Establishments ?
<BR>[Toby] : Yes, Dimple - that's great - and we can also say that One Establishments can have Visits from many People.
<BR>At this point, we can show how all these boxes are related, and that is a very big step, because it takes us to the idea of 'Relationships'.
<BR>And now we can see how useful our Identifiers can be because we can include the Person and Establishment Identifiers in our Visits table. Then the Person_ID field becomes a link to a record for a Person in the Person Table. 
<BR>This link is what is called a <B>Foreign Key</B> and we can see it's shown with <B>'FK'</B> on the left-hand side.

<BR><BR><IMG ALT="Products and Types" SRC="images/ip_products_and_types.gif">
<BR>[Dimple] : Toby, when we go into a shop we want to buy something.
<BR>And there are thousands and thousands of possibilities.
<BR>How do we deal with all that in our little Data Model ?
<BR>[Toby] : Well Dimple, it's really quite easy. It's like all our Modelling where we look for simple patterns that cover many situations.
<BR>[Dimple] : Hmm - I don't know what that means. Maybe if you showed me I might understand it.
<BR>[Toby] : OK. 
<!---
<BR>Everything that we buy is called a Product, and all we have to do is simply define the type of each Product - such as a Coffee, Muffin or a Newspaper.
<BR>Then we draw a little box called Products and say that every Product has a Type.
<BR>In other words, there is a Relationship between the Products and Product_Types boxes.
<BR>The lines are called Relationships and they are very important in Data Modelling.
<BR>We are now creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram or "ERD".

<BR><BR>[Toby] : Finally, we show this Herarchy by a dotted line that in the top-right hand corner in the Entity called 'Ref_Types_of_Products'.

<BR>[Toby] : We already said that we have Local People and Tourists.
<BR>Some of these Local People are shoppers and some of them will be working in the shops.

<BR>[Dimple] : Toby, how do we specify that Staff work in Establishments ?
<BR>[Toby] : Dimple, that's a very good question.
<BR>Fortunately, the answer is very easy, and we simply add a <B>One-to-Many Relationship</B> between the Staff and the Establishment.
<!---
<BR><B>16b11) STAFF, ESTABLISHMENTS AND DERIVED FIELDS :</B>
<BR> In English, we would say that a <B>One-to-Many Relationship</B> means every member of Staff must work in one Establishemnt and every Establishment can employ many members of Staff.
<BR>In the diagram, we show this with a <B>Foreign Key</B> by the establishment_id field in the Staff Entity.
<BR>So if we look closely at the Staff Entity, we will see <B>'FK'</B> by the establishment_id field.

<BR>There is one more thing I have to say.

<BR>These Rules help us to produce good Data Models and so they they are very important.
<BR><B>16d) STAFF, ESTABLISHMENTS AND DERIVED FIELDS :</B>
<BR>One of the Rules is that we cannot include any bits of data that can be derived from any other bits of data.
<BR>For example, we usually want to know how many people work in a Shop or Cafe.
<BR>Therefore we include a <B>Staff Count</B> field with the Establishment.

<BR><B>16e) STAFF, ESTABLISHMENTS AND DERIVED FIELDS :</B>
When it comes to finding the derived value that goes in here, we will count the records in the Staff Table for each Establishment.
<BR>Therefore, it's a <B>derived Field</B> and we call it a name that starts with 'derived_' to make things clear.
