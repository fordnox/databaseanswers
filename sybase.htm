<LI>QUESTION 2: Where can I get a third-party Tool to Monitor Performance in a <FONT COLOR=red>Sybase Database ?</FONT> 
<LI>ANSWER   2 : A company called <A HREF="http://www.actualit.com">Actual I.T.</A> (pronounced "Actuality") markets a range of
performance monitoring tools.

<PRE><FONT SIZE=2>
They have a tool called Application Expert - or AppX for short. 
It is an application performance analysis tool, rather than a real-time monitoring solution. 
AppX is used for pre-deployment performance profiling of n-tier apps, response-time analysis of 
application transactions, network capacity-planning, or for performance troubleshooting 
- is it the application, the network, client or server?  
It is generic across a number of IP-based apps - including Sybase, Oracle, MS SQL-Svr, DB2, HTTP, TCP, UDP, etc.

To monitor a Sybase application in real-time, then their FirstSense solution is more appropriate. 
This is a client agent-based solution, that monitors application transactions in real-time, and 
produces reports showing the performance of transactions across the user-base, again showing 
whether response-time issues are due to the client, server or network.

To monitor download response-time of a web-site that's driven by a Sybase back-end, 
then the Keynote Perspective service should be considered. 
This is a subscription-based service that monitors any number of URL's or transactions from up to 
nearly 200 agents located on tier-1 and 2 ISP backbone providers, and simulate your customers 
downloading the page/transaction every hour. 

Web-based reports reveal how the site is behaving on a geographical, metropolitan, or ISP agent basis across time. 
It is possible to compare with competitors URL's, or use industry benchmark indices that are provided. 
The reports also include information about the performance of page components together with errors.
