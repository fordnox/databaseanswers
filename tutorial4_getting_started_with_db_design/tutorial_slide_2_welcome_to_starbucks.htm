<HR><B>Introduction</B>
<LI>We start outside the Starbucks, planning to go in.
<LI>We can see Customers, and inside we can anticipate seeing a wide range of Food and Drink.
<LI>We will start by looking at a Schema for Starbucks and then moving on to Amazon.

<LI> Data Modellers would also refer to Entities, rather than Tables, for the 'Things of Interest'.
<LI>You will notice that I also refer to Tables for the same reason of being 'User-Friendly'
