<B>Our motto - Keep It Simple and Straightforward (KISS)</B>
<BR>We are starting in a simple way with this diagram which shows two Entities without a Relationship.
<BR>The Relationship between them is established in the next diagram, when the meaning of the 'PK' and 'FK' will be explained.

<BR>I want  to convey to you the value of seeing the real world as a Database Schema.
<BR>It's always very interesting and adds a challenge as you walk or drive around and 
<BR>think about how you would create a Database Schema for the real world that you can see around you.

<LI>Let's say we go into Starbucks to get a coffee and something to eat.
<LI>At this point, Starbucks doesn't know us as a Customer.
<LI>Also we might be doing the office coffee run, amd maybe we have with us our Order on a piece of paper.
<LI>These two 'Things of Interest', Products and Customer_Orders, are not related until we give our Order.
<LI>Data Modellers commonly describe a Database Schema as an Entity-Relationship-Diagram, or ERD.
<LI>The word 'Relationship' is therefore very important.
<LI>However, at this point, we haven't established a Relationship between the Products and the Customer_Orders.
<LI>We will do that in the next slide.
