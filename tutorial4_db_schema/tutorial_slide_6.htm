<HR><B>Payments</B>
<LI>Of course, we have to pay for what we have ordered before we get to consume it.
<LI>Fortunately, paying in Starbucks is quite straightforward.
<LI>In passing, let's note that the total price we have to pay is derived from the total cost of the individual items.

<BR><BR><B>Customer Payment Methods</B>
<LI>These will usually be Cash or Credit Card, and are shown in more detail in the next diagram.
<LI>Payments are simpler at Starbucks than Amazon.com, but our design is general and covers both.

<BR><BR>
<B>Derived Data</B>
<LI>The total price we have to pay is derived from the total cost of the individual items.
<LI>In a 'Normalised' Database Schema, we do not normally show derived fields, such as total figures.
<LI>This allows us to drill-down to the basic fundamental data.
<LI>We want to get to the point where we can't remove anything without losing meaning or value. 
<LI>For this reason, I have shown the total price as a 'Derived' field, and called it 'der_order_price'.
<LI>One of the strengths of the Relational Database is that it strips away everything which is not fundamental.


<BR><BR>
<B>Reference Data</B>
<LI>Reference data is important, because it occurs in virtually every Database Schema in the real world.

<BR><BR><B>Status</B>
<LI>The status of an order in Starbucks usually changes so quickly that we don't need to keep track of it.
<LI>It is shown here to anticipate its use for Amazon.com, which is more complex, as we will see later.
<LI>The Status can be part of the Customer_Orders table, and take values from the 'Ref_Order_Status_Codes' table.
