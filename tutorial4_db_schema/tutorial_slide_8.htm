<HR><B>Products</B>
<BR>Let's move on to the topic of Products. As you might imagine, this can be a complex area.
<BR>Two important aspects are Inheritance and Product Hierarchies. 
<BR><BR><B>Inheritance</B>
<LI>This diagram shows a 'Products' table that holds details that are common to all Products.
<LI>It shows an 'Amazon_Books' table that holds details that are specific to Books from Amazon.
<LI>It also shows a 'Starbucks_Products' table that holds details that are specific to Products from Starbucks.
<LI>These two are Children of the Parent 'Products' Table.
<LI>Therefore, this concept is referred to as Inheritance and is very powerful in the real world.
<LI>On the diagram, it is shown  by the circle with two short horizontal lines underneath it. 
<LI>Data Modellers define these as 'Sub-Types' of a 'Super-Type'.
<LI>This diagram shows the Logical level of the Schema. 
<LI>At the physical level, this can be implemented in one of three ways :-
<OL>
<LI>Three tables - exactly like the Logical level.
<LI>Two tables - one for Amazon and one for Starbucks, with the common data items copied down from the Parent Table.
<LI>One table - at the higher level, with common data items and those for Amazon and Starbucks all in one large table.
</OL>
  
<B>Recursive Product Hierarchy</B>
<LI>The line that comes out of the Ref_Product_Types Table and then goes back in again is informally called a 'Rabbits Ear', 
<BR>or more formally a 'Recursive Relationship'.  It defines a Product Hierarchy.
<LI>It means that any Product can be part of a higher grouping of Products, such as Categories, Types and so on.
<LI>This is a very neat and powerful way to implement this concept.
<LI>In our example, the 'parent_product_type_code' is a reference to the next highest level in the hierarchy.

<BR><BR><B>Suppliers</B>
<LI>I introduce Suppliers at this point because Starbucks and Amazon.com are both Suppliers of Products within our Schema.
<LI>This would be the starting-point for Schema involving a more detailed analysis of Suppliers.
