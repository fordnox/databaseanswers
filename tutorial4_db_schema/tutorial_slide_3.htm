<HR><B>Introduction</B>
<LI>This diagram is an overview of our Database Schema which we will be going through in detail before we review it at the end of this Tutorial.
<LI>We will be talking about a Database Schema covering Customers, Deliveries, Orders, Products and Suppliers.
<LI>We will start by looking at a Schema for Starbucks and then moving on to Amazon.
<LI>Bear in mind that the more complex solution includes the simpler one.
<LI>Before we begin, let me say that I have adopted the plural for Tables (such as 'Customers') because it is more natural than the singular form.
<LI>Strictly speaking, Data Modellers would be using the singular for a Data Model of this type, but I prefer 
a more User-Friendly approach.
<LI> Data Modellers would also refer to Entities, rather than Tables, for the 'Things of Interest'.
<LI>You will notice that I also refer to Tables for the same reason of being User-Friendly.
