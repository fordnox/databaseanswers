<PRE><FONT COLOR=blue FACE=Verdana SIZE=2><B>Case Study on Principle # 1 - Human Rights</B>
To support and respect the protection of international human rights

<B>Name of Company: Daimler Chrysler, South Africa</B> 

<B>Background & situational context</B> 
Daimler Chrysler is one of the largest auto manufacturers in the world, with manufacturing 
operations in over 37 different countries. 

The presence of Mercedes-Benz in the Republic of South Africa dates back over a century. 
In 1999, various business entities were brought together in one company, Daimler Chrysler South Africa (DCSA), 
and became wholly owned by DaimlerChrysler AG. 

In a national economy based largely on mining and agriculture, DCSA is recognized as one of the 
leading South African manufacturing companies. 
In 2001, DCSA accounted for 4,453 employees and produced 52,444 passenger cars. (Ref.1). 

<B>Problem</B>
The HIV/AIDS epidemic has had a substantial impact in the Republic of South Africa. 

Out of a total South African Population of 43.8 million in 2001, UNAIDS estimates that 
11.5% of the population are living with HIV/AIDS, while the adult prevalence rate is between the 
age group 15-49 is even higher at 20.1%. (Ref. 2) 

The same agency estimates that 360,000 people died of the because of the disease in the year 2001 alone. 

In many countries, including South Africa, HIV-testing is not carried out on a regular basis, thus prolonging 
the discovery of the virus and delaying possible treatment. 

Another problem relating to the accessibility of test sites is that they could be scarce or difficult to reach. 

Some companies have tried to fight HIV/AIDS in the workplace by requiring mandatory and open testing, compromising the right to privacy of the individual and directly discriminating 
against employees and would be employees affected with the HIV/AIDS virus. 

DCSA has been affected by the spread of HIV/AIDS, like most of other companies in South Africa. 
The company estimates that the economic impact of HIV/AIDS in 2001, as a result of infections and deaths, was 
"a staggering R9.3 million [about US $1.1 million] in direct and indirect costs to the company (40 percent as death and disability payments and 36 percent due to productivity loss)".(Ref. 3). 

<B>Actions taken</B>
DCSA first reacted to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the early 1990’s. 
However, it was not until 1996 that the company implemented its first workplace policy on HIV/AIDS, after extensive discussions between 
management, health services and the Unions (NUMSA). 

The main goals of DCSA’s workplace policy on HIV/AIDS is to prevent new infections in the workplace and among dependents, 
provide the best possible care for those living with HIV/AIDS and ensure that the company systematically and progressively 
addresses all HIV/AIDS related concerns and issues. 

One of the main reasons Delta Electronics encouraged the creation of the “Delta Labour Union” is the company’s management respect for the workers’ right to form and join trade unions. 
Herein, Delta takes into consideration the Labour Standards (ILS) formulated in the International Labour Conventions Number 87 and 98. 
These Conventions are not directly addressed to employers, but to governments of member countries of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), but they can, on a voluntary basis, serve as managerial guidelines and sources of policy and strategy formulation at the enterprise level. 

According to Dr. Clifford Panter, DCSA HIV/AIDS coordinator, there was no dedicated program funding or monitoring until 1999. During 1999 and 2000, as one of the first expressions of a more comprehensive approach to the HIV/AIDS issue, DCSA Medical fund started to provide anti-retroviral drugs for affected employees. Building on existing HIV/AIDS programmes, a comprehensive public-private partnership was also formed in 1999/2000 with the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ). Daimler Chrysler South Africa has budgeted R6 million (or about US$733,000) over a three-year period starting in 2000 for its HIV/AIDS programmes. 

Together with Government Departments, UNAIDS, and trade unions, DCSA now has the following programmes to combat HIV/AIDS; 
        1.  An education project, which is designed to provide employees, their families and their immediate communities with information through HIV/AIDS kiosks, the DCSA Intranet Help Desk, peer education and other forms of educational activities. Additionally, condoms are made available and distributed. 
        2.  Anonymous HIV-testing to employees. 
        3.  Standardized voluntary counselling for those employees affected with the disease. The company also offers training to the councillors on HIV/AIDS related issues. 
        4.  Health care coverage to provide anti-retroviral drugs to staff affected with the virus. 

<B>Results</B> 
Because of the nature of the HIV/AIDS virus and the ongoing nature of the fight against HIV/AIDS, it is very difficult to determine accurately the outcomes and impact of the company’s efforts. However, while some results are more difficult to find, others are easier to quantify. For instance, about 1,750 employees have taken advantage of the anonymous HIV/AIDS testing (Oct. 2002), 180 employees were trained as peer educators on HIV/AIDS issues and 137 employees and family members are receiving treatment for the virus (August 2002). In addition to these quantifiable outcomes, it should be noted that through the various aspects of the project, the company is addressing some very important human rights. Most notable among these are; 
*The right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health 
*The right to information and education 
The right to privacy 
The right to be free from discrimination in the workplace

<B>Case Study on Principle # 2 - Human Rights</B>

To make sure the company is not complicit in human rights abuses

Name of Company: British Petroleum (BP)1 

Background & situational context 

BP is the third-largest integrated oil company in the world, with an estimated global market share of 3% of oil & gas production, 4% of refining capacity and over 10% retail sales of refined oil products in global retail markets. It is also one of the world's three largest manufacturers of petrochemicals and has a growing business in distribution of natural gas and power generation. More than two-thirds of BP's production, refining and marketing is in the USA, Canada, Western Europe and Australasia. Worldwide the company employs more then 115 thousand people. 

Problem
It is increasingly difficult for oil companies to find significant oil reserves in western democracies. In order to maintain future prospects and satisfy increasing demand in countries all over the world, oil companies therefore increasingly have to do business in areas of the world where democracies are not well-established and fundamental human rights not well protected. 


 
Many people believe that it is often much easier for companies to avoid becoming embroiled in human rights controversies than to deal with the related practical and reputational risks. But can companies proactively plan to avoid the potential pitfalls? Moreover, many companies commit themselves to respecting the rule of law in countries of operation. But what about situations where national laws contravene basic human rights or where to uphold the letter of the law could result in human rights infringements? One such example is the apartheid laws of the old South Africa, which required racial segregation of the workforce. 


 “Open markets, steady economic development and an open society are the best conditions in which we can pursue our business. This is contrary to the common believe that companies find it easier to the apparent stability of repressive regimes than to manage the uncertainties of democracy. Stability built on repression is always false. Sooner or later the waters break the dam.” 
Sir John Browne, CEO, BP 
 
 
 
Actions taken
In early 1998, following extensive internal discussions, BP adopted a set of business policies describing the standard of care the company seeks to deliver. At the core of these of these policy commitments is the belief that the companies activities should generate a source of economic benefits and opportunities and that their conduct should be a source of positive influence. 

BP Ethical Conduct Policy now explicitly supports the principles set forth in the UN Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy. In addition, its relationships policy commits the company to demonstrating respect for human dignity and the rights of the individuals. 

The issue of complicity in human rights abuses is not easy for companies to tackle. BP, as part of their commitment to following their Ethical Conduct Policy, used a number of approaches, including research, education, prevention and partnerships. For example, before investing in new projects, the company now conducts a country risk review. Amongst other factors, this process takes into consideration the social, political, cultural and human rights context of the country using a 20-year planning horizon. Market and shareholder risks are also important factors in the process, as are potential reputational risks. This process involves a select number of internal staff from business units and the corporate centre, as well as external experts. The NGO Human Rights Watch was invited to participate in a country risk review for a country where human rights abuses where of particular concern. 

BP’s Ethical Conduct policy is supported by more detailed policy explanations, to assist staff in resolving the dilemmas surrounding ethical decision-making. In addition, more detailed guidance on specific aspects of human rights is available on the company’s Intranet. This includes a decision making model to help clarify issues –such as bribery and corruption- and the potential consequences and pitfalls. 

While some of the training on human rights related issues has been given to staff in the form of workshops, BP also uses a more innovative approach through the peer review process. Originally conceived as a technical review mechanism, the peer review process has been applied to the company’s dealings with indigenous peoples and to security provisions. It brings together centres of expertise on specific subjects within the group to review and challenge the performance of one of the business units. 

<B>Results</B> 
As the company readily admits, measuring progress on policy implementation is no easy task. At the time of this case study, the company was supporting research into social indicators to help reinforce reporting on social performance, including human rights. This process is viewed as crucial by a number of NGO’s if progress on the implementation of the Ethical Conduct policy is to stand up to objective evaluation. 

Meanwhile, BP has introduced an annual review process where each business leader must sign a letter indicating that all relevant staff have been made aware of the Ethical Conduct policy provisions, that they have an understanding of the human rights context of their operations and the operations are not resulting in human rights abuses. 

More proactively, they must also look for opportunities to promote human rights within the country of operation. 
BP is also continuing its training of employees through the Intranet and workshops. 
In 2002 alone, over 500 workshops were held on human rights related issues.

<B>Case Study on Principle # 3 - Labour Principles</B>

Freedom of association and the effective recognition
of the right to collective bargaining

Name of Company: Delta Electronics



Background & situational context 

Between 1961 and 1995 Thailand increased its Gross National Product (GNP) per capita by more than 25 times in nominal terms. After enjoying the world’s highest growth rate from 1985 to 1995, the Asian crisis in the late 1990’s affected Thailand and its economic growth considerably. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted by more than 10 percent and unemployment rose continuously. The devaluation of Thailand’s currency, the Baht, reinforced this evolution. However, the Thai economy recovered from this crisis in 1999 and has been showing a remarkable growth since then. 

Delta Electronics, founded in 1971, is a leading Asian supplier in the field of hardware electronics. Headquartered in the Samutprakarn province in Thailand, Delta employs more than 11,000 people, and has business operations and production sites all around the globe. Delta Electronics plc. affiliates four subsidiaries, which are Delta Networks, a major producer of networking products, Cyntec, a high-tech company specializing in thin film technology and products, Delta Optoelectronics, producing large size color LED display and polymer LED displays, and finally Yuasa-Delta Technology, a company manufacturing rechargeable batteries. Its executive director, Anusorn Muttaraid proudly explains: “When you open your or any other computer, I bet you will find our company logo on at least one of the hardware components.” At the time of this case study, Delta Electronics was the only ISO 14001 certified company in Thailand and enjoyed an excellent reputation in the fast moving electronics market. 

Problem
Thailand is a founding member of the ILO, which, in turn, has been providing the country with technical assistance in order to strengthen the capacity of employers’ and workers’ organizations in collective bargaining and dispute settlement, workplace cooperation, social security, and wage issues. Thailand counts 10 trade union congresses, but trade unions are rather fragmented. In February 2000, the Thai Parliament passed the State Enterprise Labour Relations Bill, which allows organizing more than one trade union in the same enterprise as well as joining any confederation of private-enterprise trade unions, and includes the right to bargain collectively. However, only 2 % of Thailand’s total workforce is unionized today, and collective bargaining is mainly carried out at the company level rather than at the industry level. 

In 1998, staff turnover at Delta Electronics was more than 8 % per month. This high level of fluctuation did not only cause significant administrative expenses, but it also led to high investment,recruitment and training cost and created an atmosphere of unrest. Furthermore, sick leaves were at levels that were not satisfying at all. In the middle of this, the company was trying to deal with the economic crisis of the late 1990’s. 

Actions taken
In order to respond to these challenges and improve the company’s competitiveness, Delta’s management decided to take active measures to improve employees’ satisfaction and identification with the company’s business goals, and to bring down turnover rates. The Board of Directors knew that its skilled and well-trained workforce was a major competitive advantage, and, in the words of one of the Board members, that “everything starts with motivation, minds and concepts”. The management introduced a policy that strongly focused on “what employees want, not what employers think they might want”. It actively encouraged the workforce to unionise, well aware of the advantages this could create with regards to opinion building, reliable negotiations, decision-making, and improved communication. It also helped the creation of a labour union with administrative and financial support. 

One of the main reasons Delta Electronics encouraged the creation of the “Delta Labour Union” is the company’s management respect for the workers’ right to form and join trade unions. Herein, Delta takes into consideration the Labour Standards (ILS) formulated in the International Labour Conventions Number 87 and 98. These Conventions are not directly addressed to employers, but to governments of member countries of the International Labour Organisation (ILO), but they can, on a voluntary basis, serve as managerial guidelines and sources of policy and strategy formulation at the enterprise level. 

Results 
The “Delta Labour Union” is now the first labour union in the EPZ (the industrial zone where the company is located), and has slowly, but steadily increasing membership figures. Tensions between workers’ and employers’ representatives have diminished significantly after it had been formed. No formal collective bargaining procedure has taken place so far, but both parties meet on a regular basis to exchange views and ideas. A newsletter is published every two months, a television program is produced, and the “labour committee”, consisting of both union members and managers, meets regularly. Additionally, the position of a Labour Relations Officer has been created, who follows up on complaints and questions. 

Three years after initiating the unionisation initiative, Delta has improved its competitive position, almost doubled its workforce, and gained new key customers. The company has also successfully tackled the problems of high staff turnover rates and sick leaves. The results are indeed impressive: 
·Annual turnover is less than 3%, compared with almost 100% at the time the initiative started 
·70% of the workforce is 100% present 
·Employee satisfaction has increased dramatically. 

By focusing on innovation and people oriented management, the company has created excellent conditions for continuing growth and expansion now and in the future.

<PRE><FONT FACE=Verdana SIZE=2><B>Case Study on Principle #4 - Labour Principles</B>
The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour

<B>Name of Company: WGA Philippines & Manila Port Authority</B>

<B>Background and Situational Context</B> 
Philippine Ports Authority is a government corporation specifically charged with the financing, management and operation of public ports throughout the archipelago. The Manila Ports the corporation manages are the largest in the country, with 3-5 Million people transiting the Northern Manila Harbor every year. A percentage of the authorities revenues are placed in a programme that carries out various developmental activities in cooperation with NGOs and government departments. 

William Gothong and Aboitiz Inc (WG&A) is the largest shipping company in the Philippines. It is engaged in passenger transport and cargo liner services on most major routes in the Phillippines archipelago. The company has helped to create jobs through the expansion of its business activities and has been named one of the Best Employers in the country by Hewitt Associates, a management-consulting firm. The company is also engaged in many corporate social responsibility initiatives from recycling programmes, support for governmental immunization efforts through its Super Garantisadong Pambata programme, and support for local schools through the donation of textbooks. 

<B>Problem</B> 
In the Philippines a significant number of adults and children are trafficked domestically from poorer areas to urban centers for the commercial sex industry and domestic work.1 These people are often promised good working conditions and a way out of poverty only to be disappointed and forced into situations that are far worse than before. For example, several years before this case study, the number of child prostitutes in Metro Manila was estimated to be at least 20,0002 , with the majority originating from the poorer areas of the Philippines. 

Visayan Forum, a Philippine NGO that provides specialized care for migrants and children in situations of domestic work and trafficking, undertook a situational analysis in 2000 of victims of trafficking transiting through Manila North Harbour. It found 2 groups of women and children who were at risk. The first of these are groups of people recruited in their home provinces by local recruiters working for traffickers. The second group were independent travelers who come to Manila looking for work or to live with families and are prey to illegal recruiters who wait at the port to prey upon these people. 

Field research has allowed local groups to identify a pattern whereby recruiter convince parents to allow their children to travel to Manila with the promise of a job in domestic work. During transport recruiters instruct children to declare false names and ages or to claim that they are relatives. At other times children travel alone hoping to join family or friends in Manila who do not pick them up at the port. These children are at risk of falling victim to recruiters who wait at the docks to find workers for prospective employers. 

<B>Actions Taken</B> 
Dealing with the problem of trafficking at the North Manila Port was something that no one company or organization could take on alone. After a series of consultative meetings between local firms, the Port Authority, the Federation of Free Workers3 and the Visayan Forum, it was recognized and agreed upon that interventions from a variety of groups were necessary to combat trafficking and forced labour in this context. The specific roles that the different actors now play are outlined below; 
Visayan Forum 
· Provides training to port police under the authority of the Manila Port Authority in issues of trafficking and cooperates with shipping companies and the police to identify victims of trafficking and those at risk of being trafficked. 
· Runs a halfway house called Balay Silungan sa Daungan in front of Pier 8 which provides 24 hour services for trafficking victims including; 
        * Emergency temporary shelter before reintegration 
        * Informational assistance about travel, employment and support networks 
        * Quick referral of cases, including legal remediation 
        * Telephone hotline counseling 
WGA Philippines4 
· Now refers cases to the halfway house and gives the half way houses contact information to children and young persons on the voyage. This kind of help provides useful information to children so they can avoid abuse and exploitation at their destination. 
· Arranges for general orientations of their shipping crew on the issue of trafficking. 
· Offers free or discounted repatriation rates to children. 
· Offers safe custody during travel of repatriated children and personally turns over the children to local social workers 
Federation of Free Workers 
· Refers stranded children or those who escaped from their employers 
· Maintains food staples for children’s consumption in the center. 
Manila Port Authority 
· Manila Port Authority provides the Visayan Forum’s half way house and also provides funds for expenses for administrative purposes and building maintenance. 
· Port staff continually refers children and other stranded passengers to the halfway house. 
· Port Police and Coast guard routinely checks suspected traffickers once the ferry has docked. 

<B>Results</B> 
In 2001 the Visayan Forum’s project reported to have removed 500 victims or people at risk of trafficking and provided assistance to them. Many of these people have either been repatriated or placed with employers in Manila. The project has been such a success that it is currently being expanded to other ports in the Philippines.

Effective abolition of Child Labour

<B>Name of Company: Sotik Tea Company Limited</B>

<B>Background & situational context</B> 
Sotik Tea Company Limited, founded in 1945, is situated in the highlands of Sotik and is close to 400 Kms. from Nairobi, in Kenya. The company manages the Sotik Highlands Tea Estates, where its Tea plantation occupies 1,800 ha and another 850 ha is fuel wood plantation. Close to 96% of tea is exported to Europe and the Middle East and thus leaving only 4% for local market. 
There are 4,500 employees. Out of this number, 2, 078 are housed in company houses while the rest of the workforce commute from their homes at their own will. An estimated population of 6,729 is said to be living in company housing units. This brings a ration of 3.4 people per unit where children account for 45% of the total inhabitants. The company encourages family employment as strategy to fight HIV/AIDS and elimination of child labour. The Kenya Plantation and Agricultural Workers Union (KPAWU) represent the workers. 
According to the Economic Survey for the year 2002, Kenya’s economy has remained in recession over the last five years. After posting a positive growth of 1.2% in 2001, from 0.2% in 2000, the economy grew by 1.1% in 2002. Inflation rate has been on the decline from 6.2 % in 2000, 5.8 % in 2001 to 2.0 % in 2002. Tight fiscal and prudent monetary policies, stable exchange rates, low demand for imports, low food prices and stable world petroleum prices were among the factors that contributed to low inflation. 

<B>Problem</B> 
Child labour has emerged as one of the most intolerable forms of child exploitation and abuse in some parts of the world. In Kenya, the history of child labour dates back to pre-independence days when Africans in the periphery of white settlements sent their children to work in the farms and homes of settlers as a source of income. To-date, information available indicates that child labour is widespread and the escalating number of children subjected to it in rural and urban areas is a threat to the social and economic fabric of the economy. 

According to a Child Labour Module Survey conducted between December 1998 and January 1999, there were 1.9 million working children aged 5-17 years in Kenya. Out of these, 984,000 were boys and 910,000 girls. The Employment Act CAP 226, Part IV on Employment of Women and Juveniles discourages the employment of children. 

In 1995, the Sotik Tea Company was under obligation to set employment criteria as part of the requirements from the shareholders and overseas buyers. The buyers required that no child labour be used in picking tea or any forms of work within the estate. The requirement was part of the campaign to ensure that multinational companies participated in efforts to eliminate child labour as part of their corporate citizenry. At the time, the company was explained that “any product that will be deemed to have been manufactured or produced with the services of children shall face a boycott in the international markets.” 

<B>Actions taken</B> 
After becoming aware of the importance of eliminating child labour, the company decided to take a more proactive approach to combat child labour, instead of waiting for it to become a serious problem. As a first step, the company appointed one of its senior managers to co-ordinate campaigns against child labour within the company. The key tasks of this coordinator are to; 
        * Liase with the Federation of Kenya Employers’ ILO/IPEC Programme Manager on 
          implementation of activities at enterprise level, 
        * Hold frequent workshops to sensitize workers and the community on negative 
          consequences of child labour, 
        * Prepare posters and other training materials on the elimination of child labour, 
        * Advise management on appropriate strategies towards elimination of child labour and, 
        * Seek advice from local people and convene meetings with village elders. 

The company is also continuously evaluating auxiliary programmes to combat child labour. These auxiliary programmes include a school bursary fund, a benevolent fund, saving and credit co-operative scheme and a strategic alliances in support of education materials for workers’ children. Sotik Tea management is participating in the IPEC Programme (International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour), which is nationally administered in Kenya. In addition, the Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE) has been implementing a programme that targets employers in the plantation sector, through which guidelines on the elimination of child labour are provided. A workshop organized by the Federation under the IPEC programme on 4th June 1999 in Nakuru provided a roadmap on the programme approach for the management of Sotik Tea. 

<B>Results</B> 
As a result of all these actions, Sotik Tea is one of the companies in Kenya where child labour no longer exists. Its efforts to find partners for education materials and scholarships, along with a zero tolerance of child labour at the estate have contributed to a significant increase in the enrolment rate at the local school. Sotik Tea has also adopted an open policy towards social audits including surveillance audits on child labour. As a result, the company has fully complied with the Tea Sourcing Partnership (TSP) requirements on juvenile employment clause. This is monitored annually by TSP. 

The collaboration between Sotik Tea and FKE has been a success story. All workers and the community are well informed on the ills of child labour. The company is committed to sustaining these campaigns. Future plans include extending the current campaign to cover house helpers, continuing to provide new posters, preparing ‘role model’ audio visual aides, organizing company festival events and soliciting more support from outside stakeholders.

<B>Case Study Number 6</B>
<B>Case Study on Principle #6 - Labour Principles</B>

Eliminate discrimination in respect of employment and occupation

<B>Name of Company: B & Q</B>

<B>Background & situational context</B>
The British Do It Yourself (DIY) house improvement market place is a crowded one. 
Take any exit off the country’s busiest motorway, the M25, and you are likely to find a space in 
one of the vast car-parks surrounding an assortment of huge brightly coloured buildings bearing the 
names of Britain's leading DIY retailers: Focus Do It All, Homebase, Wickes, Great Mills and B&Q. 
Of these, B&Q plc is Britain’s leading DIY retailer with annual sales of $US3.9 billion, 
owning 13.5% of the repair, maintenance and improvement market share. 
Worldwide the company now employs over 35,000 employees and has sales of nearly $US6 billion. 
In addition to its economic prowess, B&Q is also now widely recognised as a corporate leader in the 
social, ethical and environmental arenas. 

One of B&Q’s pioneering corporate responsibility initiatives was introduced more than a decade ago. 
This initiative, started in 1989, was a pilot employment policy to promote the employment of older 
people and was one of the company’s first diversity initiatives. 

<B>Problem</B> 
Discrimination against people on the basis of age is not uncommon in the United Kingdom. The Institute for Employment Studies (IES) has found that between 25-34% of British employers use explicit age bars on jobs (IES in B&Q, 1995). The UK government itself has estimated that at least 40% of employers discriminate on the grounds of age (Ottaway, 1995). Whereas other European countries, including France and Spain, have age-related legislation (such as a ban on using age limits in job advertisements), the UK still has no legislation to prevent age discrimination. There are plans to change this policy as the Trade and Industry Department of Government are drafting changes in legislation. The proposed regulations are being brought under the European legislation on discrimination – and must be implemented by the end of 2006. 

B&Q and various non-governmental organisations (NGOs) argue that discriminatory employment practices related to age pay no attention to significant social and demographic changes such as the rapid growth in Britain’s ageing population. More than 40% of the UK workforce is currently over 45 years. Furthermore the past 15 years has seen a substantial decrease in the number of 20-24 year olds in employment. Ageism in the workplace creates physical and mental hardship not only for over 50s but also for their dependants. Contrary to public assumptions, research conducted by B&Q found that 58% of staff over 50 years had members of their family that depended on them financially and 16% had to care for relatives, mainly parents who were elderly or infirm (B&Q, 1995a). Commenting on the survey results, then B&Q Chairman, Jim Hodkinson said that: 
        “Increased life expectancy, a growing number of people not willing or able to rely on the state 
        to look after dependants and an increasing proportion of older people against a backdrop of a 
        falling number of school leavers; these are all factors which need to be considered in planning 
        recruitment policies.” 

<B>Addressing the Problem</B>
During 1989, recruiting from the core labour pool became more difficult for the company and it was forced to adopt more flexible policies with regards to hiring older employees. B&Q’s efforts to promote diversity in its workforce were therefore strongly rooted in commercial realities. The fact that older people were more likely to have knowledge and experience in the DIY trade, along with an urgent need to address changing UK demographics and the need for well-motivated retail staff, caused B&Q to launch its so-called Grey Revolution in 1989. B&Q’s Lorian Coutts explains that the initiative was a reaction to severe shortages in the labour market at the time: 
        “The adoption of our over 50s policy was, for the most part, a reaction to the changing job 
        market in the late eighties. They provided an under-used pool of labour.” 

Initially, the Board of Directors did have some concerns regarding older employees working with some of the more physically demanding aspects of the job and working with new technology. B&Q therefore decided to test the new programme with an initial job advertisement for 55 new employees for a store in Macclesfield, UK. After the programme proved very successful (see below), the company learnt that socially, as well as economically, having a larger representation of older labour is very beneficial for all parties concerned. 

In 1999 the company updated the retirement policy by removing restrictions around retirement to allow individuals the opportunity to review their own working life and reach a decision on based on their financial resources and family needs. 

<B>Results</B> 
When Warwick University initially evaluated the new store where people over 50 were hired, store against other stores it topped the list on most measures. In her independent review of the Grey Revolution initiative, Mandy Jetter (1993) notes the following achievements: “a massive reduction in unattributable stock loss, and a very low absentee rate, [and] the best sales award for the whole of B&Q. Other figures cited by B&Q to demonstrate the new over-50s store’s success compared to other B&Q retail outlets at the time include; 
        · Profits 18% higher 
        · Staff turnover 6 times lower 
        · Absenteeism 39% lower 
        · Shrinkage 59% lower 
        · Improved customer perception of service 
        · Increased skill base in the staff team 

B&Q has not continued to pursue an only-50s employment policy for specific stores. B&Q’s aim is simply “to achieve a balance of ages throughout the company to reflect the age profiles of communities in which the stores are based.” 

In order to build on the success of the pilot project, the company initially adopted an ‘over 50’ target of 10% of the workforce, this target was later revised to at least 15% of staff. Between 1991 and 1998, the percentage of employees that were over 50 years of age in B&Q stores rose from 7.3% to 13% (excluding temporary staff). Today, 18% of B&Q employees are over 50 years old and its oldest employee is 89.

<B>Case Study on Principle # 8 - Environment Principles Number 3</B>

Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility

Name of Company: Nokia



Background & situational context 

This example, submitted by Nokia in 2002, describes a programme at Nokia to reduce waste during the manufacturing stage of the product life cycle. The activities address Principle 8 of the Global Compact. 

Nokia is one of the largest mobile communications companies in the world, with net sales in 2002 reaching over US$30 Billion. Worldwide the company employs 52 thousand people and has 17 production centres in 9 different countries. Nokia comprises two business groups: Nokia Mobile Phones and Nokia Networks. In addition, the company includes a separate Nokia Ventures Organization and the corporate research unit, Nokia Research Center. 

The Problem 

Nokia points out that the driving force for materials recycling is – 

. the rise in the number of mobile phones being produced, which has put pressure both on the 
   cost of waste disposal and the space available to store waste, 
. stakeholder expectation for better environmental management, 
. anticipated changes in legislation on recycling, and 
. an initiative of the employees. 
The simple but effective solution that Nokia came up with was to place containers where the waste originated, to instruct production staff on how to sort the waste, and to identify (or create) suppliers and recycling companies that would collect the waste. 

Addressing the problem: 

The basic process was as follows – 
1.   Nokia analysed the kind of waste that was being produced at each production site, 
2.   It discussed with its suppliers and manufacturing departments about the possibilities to minimise waste or improve materials, and then evaluated different reuse / recycling solutions, 
3.   The company then evaluated any remaining potential for material recycling, 
4.   It set up the sorting bins, created sets of instructions and carried out training, and 
5.   Finally it followed up, for example by carrying out "purity checks" of the landfill fraction, to make sure that nothing could still be "used". 

Results 

Some of the results are that Nokia’s factories have been able to reduce appreciably the amount of waste generated throughout the manufacturing process. For example, in the Salo mobile phone factory in Finland, more than 80% of incoming materials now end up inside the telephones. Through simple waste management measures, 16% of the remaining materials are reused or recycled and landfill waste now represents only 0.2%. In China it was found that most of the waste at Nokia’s Beijing factory was from packaging materials that came with the components. The packaging material was largely recyclable and could be sent back to the suppliers for re-use. Electronics components make up only a small part of the waste volume. However, they also have a metal value when recycled. 

Nokia mentions that the programme has tapped into the creativity of Nokia’s employees, as it has required them to identify new uses for the separated waste streams. It also points out that, as a result of ISO 14001 certification, the standardised environmental training in the Nokia factories has facilitated the sharing of “best practices” between different business units and factories. Co-operation with industry bodies, such as Finland's State Technology Research Centre and the European Information and Communications Technology Association (EICTA) was also important. They observe that the fact that both the company and society have benefited has made it easier to encourage the development of the recycling programmes within Nokia’s factories around the world.

<PRE><FONT COLOR=blue FACE=Verdana SIZE=2><B>Case Study on Principle # 9 - Environment 3
Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally sensitive technologies

<B>Name of Company: BASF</B>
<B>Background & situational context</B> 

BASF is one of the biggest chemical companies in the world. Its product line comprises high-value-added chemicals, plastics, colorants and pigments, dispersions, automotive and industrial coatings, crop-protection agents, fine chemicals, oil and gas. Worldwide, BASF employs around 93 thousand people and operates production facilities in 38 different countries. 

BASF’s support for the environmental Principle 9 is illustrated by their work on eco-efficiency analysis and, in particular, the company’s efforts to promote this approach to other businesses world-wide. 


<B>The Problem</B> 
The purpose of BASF eco-efficiency analysis is to address disharmony and lack of integration between economy and ecology. This applies from product design throughout the life cycle of the product. Its eco-efficiency model serves as a tool for helping business activities to become sustainable. Since 1996 the company has gained a wide range of experience in applying this software-based instrument at the operational level to evaluate which business activities are worth pursuing from a sustainability point of view. BASF was one of the first chemical companies to develop eco-efficiency analysis for its products and processes. 

Addressing the problem 
In the first stage of the analysis one assesses the environmental impact – taking into account factors such as raw material and energy consumption, air and water emissions, disposal methods, potential toxicity and further risks. The second step then involves compiling economic data by calculating all the various costs involved in manufacturing and/ or using the product. Next both data sets are plotted on a graph, as shown above, to obtain the eco-efficiency of a product or process. By carrying out the eco-efficiency analysis for comparable alternative products or processes [those of BASF as well as of its competitors], BASF is able to detect and exploit potential environmental and economic improvements that can guide long-term strategic decisions. To date BASF has analysed around 120 of its products and production processes. The analysis can be used to assess the complete lifecycle of a product by taking into consideration the environmental impact of the product and its manufacturing processes, 
consumer behaviour and recycling and disposal possibilities. 

<B>Results</B> 

BASF believes that its eco-efficiency analysis provides a tool to assess the environmental soundness of different technologies.  In a bid to diffuse this knowledge, BASF has taken steps to make its eco-efficiency analysis available to other companies and organisations, in particular those from developing countries.  The company has organised symposiums for business and civil society organisations to discuss the potential of the tool and has organised training workshops to highlight the benefits of eco-efficiency analysis within the framework of the Global Compact.  BASF has developed a manual that explains how to use the tool and illustrates lessons the company has learned in the course of applying it to their own business.  It has joined the Global Compact agencies UNIDO and UNEP in applying the analysis in a demonstration at the National Cleaner Production Centre (NCPC) in Morocco.
