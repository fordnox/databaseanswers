<BR><B>Added : March 17th.2003 -</B>
<BR>Since I first wrote these words, things have changed significantly - again.
<BR>My personal outlook has changed from Cold Fusion to Microsoft ASPs. 
<BR>This was because I found it hard to locate Cold Fusion developers at an 
affordable price, and 
<BR>equally hard to locate affordable ISPs to host Cold Fusion.   
<BR>The most important development in recent months has been Macromedia's Dreamweaver MX and ColdFusion MX. 
<BR>I have updated this Page to include a mention of 
<A HREF="http://www.codecharge.com" TARGET=_NEW><B>CodeCharge</B></A>, 
<BR>which I like because it seems to offers the same facilities as DreamWeaver, 
for a fraction of the price at $139,
<BR>
<BR>I have added a listing a few of the available <A HREF="dev_tools.htm">Development Tools</A>, which
are aimed specifically at 
<BR>developing Database-backed Web Sites, especially <A HREF="coldfusion.htm"><FONT COLOR=blue FACE=Verdana SIZE=2>ColdFusion</A>, which is my personal favorite.

<BR><BR><B>Original Text :-</B><PRE><FONT COLOR=blue FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>This summary is abstracted from a review published by <A HREF="http://www.pc-team.de/codecharge/KritikArchiv001.htm" TARGET=_NEW>the PC-Team</A>, a German Web Site.
The development of Web applications has evolved significantly during the past year or two. 
The requirement is ideally a Tool which can generate code for either UNIX or Windows,
using different languages (Perl, ASP, Java, PHP, etc.).
The basic components for Web application development are a Web server and a browser. 
After choosing a programming language, server-side code is created. 
Typically, such code receives input from the browser and interacts with internal resources 
such as a database or other applications. 
The browser, for the most part, contains the presentation layer. 
Issues like graphics schemes, styles, and color schemes must be decided and then implemented 
in a way that the browser can display. 
The collection of HTML Pages is mapped into the application logic as a series of requests and responses.
</PRE>

<HR>

There are different approaches to development of Database-backed Web Sites :-
<OL>
<LI>Write code for Java Server Pages,(JSPs), or Microsoft Active Server Pages,("ASPs").
<LI>Use PHP with MySQL.
<LI>Use a commercial product to generate code for your choice, specifically designed for this purpose, such as CodeCharge or UltraDev.
</OL>

<P>1) Of these options, ASPs are easy to learn because they are just like
Visual Basic embedded in HTML.
For a book, check out Professional Active Server pages, 2.0, from WROX Press
(ISBN 1861001266).
<P>2) An example of PHP with MySQL can be seen on this Page <A HREF="data_models/hotels/chk_guest_list.php3">for a Hotel Reservation System.</A>

<P>3) For CodeCharge, check out 
<A HREF="http://www.codecharge.com/" TARGET=_NEW>their Web Site</A>, which also offers Template Code 
for a variety of useful applications, such as Portals.
<P>4) For UltraDev, since I first wrote this things have changed again since 
I recommended a product called Drumbeat. 
<BR>At the end of January,2001, it was announced that Macromedia,(with Ultradev) have 
taken over Cold Fusion.
<BR>So we can expect the two products to merge into one with the aim of complete domination
of 'open' Web Development Toolkits. 
<BR>But it will probably take a while because they are both well-established mature products.
<BR>It was also supported by an impressive training program and priced competitively.
<BR>So I believe that Cold Fusion and Ultradev are now on a par and which you choose
<BR>may depend on factors such as your starting-point and current skill-set.
<BR>Ultradev is positioned to appeal to designers who want to extend the high level of 
<BR>visual design of Dreamweaver with Database support.

<HR>

<FONT COLOR=blue SIZE=4><B>ANSWER :</B></FONT>
<BR><BR><B>Step 1 : Choose a Product</B>
<PRE><FONT FACE=Verdana SIZE=2>
Here are three options :-
1) Cold Fusion, (from MacroMedia)
2) IBM WebSphere Studio
2) Ultradev, (also from MacroMedia).

Because :-
1) Microsoft Access is not powerful enough
2) Microsoft SQL Server is not easy to use for a beginner to Database applications.
3) Neither are Oracle and IBM DB2.

Cold Fusion is my first recommmendation. I've used it myself
and found it very easy to get started and it's very intuitive.

I also tried Ultradev but it has a steep learning curve and I
coudn't spare the time. 

If you are already familiar with Dreamweaver, one aspect of Ultradev that 
might make it worth trying is that it is owned by Macromedia, who own Dreamweaver, 
so they can be integrated well, although I don't think that knowing Dreamweaver 
will help you in learning Ultradev.

So if you want to see results early on (which is always
gratifying and encouraging), try Cold Fusion.
Cold Fusion is also easy for people with a Database background and provides
'CF Tags' which offer Database-specific extensions to HTML.
</PRE>

<HR><B>Step 2 : Buy a Book</B>
<PRE><FONT FACE=Verdana SIZE=2>
In particular, look for a simple book for the beginner which 
has a CD-ROM with the necessary software to get you started.
Bear in mind that you need :-
1) a Client (front-end) development enviroment.
2) a Server (back-end) to intepret the ColdFusion tags
   and generate HTML for the Browser.
Make sure both of these are on the CD-ROM.

Here are three options :-
1) <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764506048/qid=958203683/sr=1-3/103-6466116-6286244">Coldfusion 4 for Dummies</A> ISBN: 0764506048, which costs only $19.99 on <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com.</A>
   People are often disparaging about the Dummies series, but the one or two I've
   bought have been very good.

2) Here's one I bought today !!! (May 6th. 2002), written by the highly-respected 
   'Cold Fusion Evangelist', Ben Forta. It comes with 30-day versions of Cold Fusion Express
   and HomeSite on a CD-ROM :-
      <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672316625/qid%3D1020713319/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F0%5F1/002-1836513-9597644" TARGET=_NEW>SAMS Teach Yourself ColdFusion Express in 24 hours</A>, (4.5 Stars out of 5 on Amazon). <IMG SRC="images/new.gif">

3) The <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/078971809X/o/qid=958233836/sr=2-1/103-6466116-6286244">Coldfusion 4.0 Web Application Construction Kit</A> - ISBN: 078971809X 
   Author : Ben Forte, price $39.99 at Amazon.com, and 4.5 Stars out of 5 Stars from 81 reviews.
   This is the book which everybody likes. Ben Forte works for MacroMedia, the vendors
   of Cold Fusion, and he is highly regarded as the evangelist for Cold Fusion.

4) Then there is also a follow-on - Advanced Cold Fusion 4 Application Development 
   4.5 Stars on Amazon, by the same author, (ISBN: 0789718103). 
   Cold Fusion has an e-commerce option, so you can see it's a product for the long-haul.

So if you have a long-term requirement, and money is not a show-stopper, then buy
the Ben Forte book, and set aside a week-end to get started and see some progress.
Otherwise, I'd recommend the ColdFusion Express book,(number 2).
</PRE>

<BR><B>Step 3 : Install the Software</B>
<BR>Install the Cold Fusion software off the CD-ROM at the back of the book.
<BR>If you have problems, check out the Discussion Group, described in Step 5.
<BR><BR><B>Step 4 : Spend a few days on the first few lessons</B>

<BR><BR><B>Step 5 :  Check out a Discussion Group</B>
<BR>This is especially helpful if you have come across problems.
<BR>A Discussion group for Cold Fusion would normally be on Deja.com, 
<BR>but you will find the <A HREF="http://forums.allaire.com/DevConf/index.cfm">
Cold Fusion Discussion Group</A> on the vendor's Site.
<BR>and you should check out the
<A HREF="http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/programming/coldfusion/">
Web Monkey Cold Fusion</A> Web Site

<BR><BR><B>Step 6 : Find an ISP which hosts Cold Fusion</B> 
<BR>If you want to publish your Cold Fusion Pages over the Internet, 
<BR>you will need to find an ISP which hosts Cold Fusion, and fortunately 
<BR>there's quite a choice because Cold Fusion is very popular.

<BR>Go to a Web Site such as
 <A HREF="http://www.findahost.com/" TARGET=_NEW>
Find a Host</A>, <A HREF="http://www.findyourhosting.com/" TARGET=_NEW>Find Your Hosting</A>,  
or <A HREF="http://www.devshed.com/Hosting_Search/" TARGET=_NEW>DevShed Hosting Search</A>,
<BR>and enter 'cold fusion' or  'coldfusion' in the Search box.
<BR>You'll get about 92 results from FindAHost,(last time I checked on May 2nd.). 
<BR>In fact the FindaHost Site is driven by Cold Fusion !!!
<BR>Ultradev, in contrast, returns only 10 ISPs.

<HR>And that's all there is to it !!!
