We have not been able to find a definition of Data Architecture that is good enough.
<BR>Therefore, we have produced our own definition, which we have based on the
<BR>definition of an Architecture for a house which defines a number of <B>Rooms</B> :-
<LI>Each Room has a defined purpose. 
<LI>All the Rooms combine together to serve some overall useful purpose.
<LI>Each Room has a clearly-defined interface with adjacent Rooms.
<LI>Each Room has at least one point of Entry and Exit.

<BR><BR>We have developed a General Approach to the design of Data Architectures, based on the 
<BR>identification of 'Data Islands' linked by Bridges which have specified Interfaces to control
<BR>Data Transfer over the Bridges.
<P>We have successfully applied our Approach to :-
<OL>
<LI><A HREF="crm/general_approach.htm">a CRM Data Architecture.</A>
<LI><A HREeeF="bus_intelligence/general_approach.htm">a Business Intelligence Data Architecture.</A>
<LI><A HREeeF="ecommerce/general_approach.htm">an e-Commerce Data Architecture.</A>
</OL>

<P>It is intended that this Approach should be adopted and enhanced on the basis of experience, 
<BR>so that it defines the 'Standards of Best Practice' for this activity.

<P>A separate Page discusses <A HREF="need_for_data_arch.htm"><B>why we need a Data Architecture.</B></A>


<P>The Approach is defined as a series of Steps,with associated Background comments, 
<BR>some clearly-defined <A HREF="deliverables.htm">Deliverables</A>,and some sample Template Forms which can be used 
<BR>in the application of the Approach to a specific Project.

<P>The General Approach is based on designing the Architecture at
<A HREeeF="sample_docs/three_levels.doc">three Levels of Specification :-
<LI>The Logical Level
<LI>The Physical Level
<LI>The Implementation Level


<!---
<P>The Data Architecture is designed in one of three Stages  :-
<P><LI><B>Stage 1 : Create the Logical Design.</B>
<P><LI><B>Stage 2 : Create the Physical Design.</B>
<P><LI><B>Stage 3 : Create the Implementation Design for a Pilot Project</B>
