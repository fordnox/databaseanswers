This Page defines a General Approach to the design of an integrated Data Model from a number of different 'Data Islands'
or Applications.</B>

<P>This Approach is based on a sequence of Steps in a structured method to <B>establish the FACTS</B> :-

<BR><FONT SIZE=2>
<OL>
<LI>Review of individual Data Models and establishing any overlap, 
<LI>dentify any inconsistencies and areas where data mapping needs to be defined.
<LI>Define the Area of Interest,(e.g. CRM).
<LI>Define the "Things of Interest",(e.g. Customers), in the Area of Interest.
<LI>Analyze the Things of Interest and identify the corresponding Tables. 
<LI>Establish the relationships between the Tables. 
<LI>Determine the characteristics of each Table,(e.g. a Customer has a Date-of-Birth). 
<LI>Obtain a small set of Sample Data, 
<BR>e.g. "John Doe is a Maintenance Engineer and was born on 1st. August, 1965 and 
lives at 22 Woodland Street, New Haven.
<LI>Confirm the first draft of the Database design against the Sample Data.
<LI>Obtain from the users some representative enquiries for the Database, 
<BR>e.g. "How many Calls did John Doe make last month ?"
<LI>Review the Results of Steps 1) to 7) with appropriate people, such as Users, Managers, 
<BR>Development staff, etc. and repeat until the final Data Model design is reached.
