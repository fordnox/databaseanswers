The 'Things' are the School, the Classrooms, the Teachers, the Students, 
<BR>Subjects and Classes, but excluding, for example, Books.

<TD VALIGN=top><FONT COLOR=blue FACE=Verdana SIZE=2>Here we define the Business Rules that our Database must comply with.
<BR>For example -
<BR>R.1 In a School there can be many Classrooms.
<BR>R.2 In a Classroom, there can be many Students.
<BR>R.3 Each Student can register for many Classes.
<BR>R.4 A Subject can be taught in many Classes.
<BR>R.5 Each Teacher can teach many Classes.
<HR>
In a Classroom there will (usually) be one Teacher and 
<BR>many Students (as we show on the left).

From the Business Rules we can create a conceptual Data Model that looks like this -

We can identify things that are small in number by a Name or Code.
<BR>This applies to the School and Classrooms and perhaps Teachers.
<BR>For other things, like Classes or Students, we usually generate numbers, such as ABC123.
<BR>Then, of course, we keep a table to translate each number to a specific name.

Our Logical Model has more details and is a big step to the physical Database.
<BR>Because of the detail, we used a commercial software Data Modelling package,
<BR>which we can use to generate the Database.

Finally, we create the Cloud Service. 

<!-------- using

Oracle's Apex.</A>
----------------->

<BR>This allows anybody to use our Database in the UK or around the world.
<BR>They can monitor attendance, print off Attendance Reports and so on.
