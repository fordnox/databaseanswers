This Model dates from 2001 and shows how Inheritance helps us to model both <A HREF="../customers_commercial_and_personal/index.htm">Commercial and Personal Customers</A>.
<BR><BR>However it doesn't show any details of other things that we are interested in, like Payment Methods.
<BR><BR>So we look for another Model which is a more suitable starting-point for a Customer who is going to make a Purchase.

<BR><BR>This Model dates from 2006 and shows a general solution for Customers and Addresses.

<BR>We will have to add more Customer-related items to the Customer Entity but it is fine for a starting-point.

<BR><BR>
This Model dates from 2010 and was part of a Master Data Management (MDM) approach.
<BR>It includes Payment Methods and the MDM approach is good for this current work so we decide to includ it in our Top-Level Model.
<BR><BR>So we choose this <A HREF="../customers_and_payments_e_govt/customers_and_payments_subject_area.htm">Customers and Payments</A> Model
and will adapt it to suit our requirements.

<BR><BR>This <A HREF="../retail_customers/customers_and_orders_model.htm">Customers and Orders Model</A> dates from 2010. 


<BR><BR>It includes (Customer-related) Mailshots and (Promotion-related) Promotions.
It is comprehensive so we decide to include it.

<BR><BR>Logically, these are equivalent but the Parties approach is more general and professional.
