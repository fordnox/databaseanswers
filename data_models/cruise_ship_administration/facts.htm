Back to the <A HREF="index.htm">Data Model</A>

<PRE><FONT COLOR=blue FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>Subject: Cruise Ship Booking and Accounting Database System

Question: A database must be constructed for the following Cruise Ship Booking and Accounting System: 
Accommodation in different categories of staterooms (or cabins) . 

There may be zero, one, or many <B>passengers</B> (up to 2 adults and 2 children) in a given <B>stateroom</B> but a 
passenger cannot occupy more than one stateroom at a time 

the <B>crew</B> provide various <B>amenities</B>, some free, others at a <B>charge</B>, during their <B>stay</B>. 

Passengers do not pay for their food, but there is a <B>surcharge</B> for each <B>meal</B> when they dine at the 
prestigious <B>Todd English restaurant</B> or at the <B>First Mate's pub</B>. 

You should not charge guests for <B>shows, lectures or movies</B> but these should be recorded with the 
<B>amenities</B> so that the <B>bulletin</B> can publish what <B>entertainment</B> is available on a given day. 

<B>Entertainment is a subtype of Amenity</B> where <B>the day of cruise and time</B> is recorded. 

There is no booking for entertainment (first come, first served) but <B>certain amenities must be booked</B> 
for e.g. a <B>beauty therapy appointment</B> - and others e.g. drinks on deck are not booked for. 

Attached to each <B>room-category</B> is a certain <B>charge for the entire cruise</B> and a certain <B>gratuity rate 
per day</B> of the cruise . 

<B>Activities or Amenities</B> include <B>shore excursions</B>, most <B>drinks (fruit drinks, tea, coffee, 
hot chocolate free), phone calls, internet, beauty therapy, a variety of bars, health spa, chiropractic treatment</B> and others. 

Each different <B>amenity has a code, a description and a charge attached (if applicable); and an attendant who
administers or manages the amenity (treatment)</B>. 

<B>Attendants are paid a basic salary and then may get commission</B> according to their activity participation or 
per treatment. 

Tips are not necessarily recorded, because they may be cash. 

You should allow for <B>two subtypes of dining places: dining rooms and restaurants</B>. 

All <B>dining places have attributes Maitre'd and capacity and daily menus</B>. 

<B>Your database does not have to include menus</B> or general dining staff on duty details. 

<B>Restaurants can be King's Court open restaurants or other restaurants</B>. 

<B>King's Court restaurants have as an attribute Buffet_Status</B>, 

<B>other restaurants have an attribute surcharge and Open_status</B>. 

<B>Some restaurants are only open when the weather is suitable.</B>
 
Note that <B>a given restaurant will change it's buffet status and open status regularly</B>. 

The passengers are automatically assigned to one of 3 dining rooms, depending on their status 
(which level their stateroom is found). But they might decide to miss a meal, or dine at one of 
the other restaurants, where they may have to book. 

<B>You must keep a record of which dining room the passenger is assigned to or compute it automatically</B> 

when the passenger embarks (and at other times when necessary) 

The King's Court area has 4 restaurants: 
Lotus Carvery 
La Piazza Chef's Grill 
One of the top three is always buffet and the other two are subject to dinner bookings. 

This is . on an informal rotation basis - 
e.g. Monday buffet is Lotus 
     Tuesday buffet is Carvery 
     Wednesday buffet is La Piazza etc.. 

You always have to book at Chef's Grill. 

The database must keep a record of which restaurant is buffet for each day of the cruise. 

The 3 dining rooms are 
1. Britannica, 
2. Princess Grill 
3. Queen's Grill. 

Passengers are assigned a table number at their allocated dining room 

There are five restaurants where booking for the day's evening meal is allowed :-
1. Todd English 
2. First Mate's Pub 
3. King's Court 
4. King's Court 
5. Chef's Grill 

The database must keep <B>a record of all current bookings</B> and assign a <B>table number</B> to a given guest 
(by stateroom number). 

The passengers can also book for <B>shore excursions</B> when the <B>ship</B> visits a <B>port</B>. 

A passenger can book for several shore excursions on a cruise and each <B>excursion</B> can accommodate many, 
but a limited number of, <B>passengers</B>. 

Each day of the cruise is assigned a <B>dress code</B>. 
Dress codes which apply for after 18h00 are 
1) Formal , 
2) Semi-formal, 
3) Smart Casual and 
4) Casual. 

The database must keep a record of each <B>day of the cruise and the dress code for that day</B>, as well as whether the clocks must be turned back or forward one hour at midnight 
if applicable when travelling east-west or west-east. 

The database must also keep a record of <B>birthdays and anniversaries for passengers</B> where applicable 

Your database must have sufficient information to print the daily bulletin and make announcements on the Cruise Director morning talk show (on the stateroom TV): giving 
1. dress code, 
2. status of restaurants, 
3. port of call if applicable, 
4. entertainment offered, 
5. notices of special days for passengers, 

You must keep sufficient information in your database to enable a passenger to book for an evening meal at a 
restaurant or an excursion, and an <B>invoice</B> to be created to charge the passengers for their cruise, 
including all <B>amenities</B>. 

You may assume a guest may occupy <B>more than one stateroom during their stay, i.e. they may move cabins</B> or be upgraded.
