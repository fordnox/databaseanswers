<HR><PRE><FONT COLOR=blue FACE=Verdana SIZE=2><B>A Global Bank Reduces Churn</B>
A large global bank was struggling with reducing churn in profitable customer segments. 
A key challenge was integrating customer interaction data across multiple channels from numerous silo’ed repositories. 

The size of the data – billions of records per month - also made the analysis of this information a very complex exercise.

Leveraging the powerful analytic capability of the <B>Teradata Unified Data Architecture</B>, this leading financial institution 
built an enterprise view of all customer interactions and identified the most frequent paths to account closure across all 
interaction channels. 
As a result, the bank expects to reduce churn among profitable customers by 5%, simply by identifying and removing 
events that were causing a high number of account closures.

Technology leveraged includes:
A Teradata Enterprise Data Warehouse for historical customer transaction, profile and product information
Teradata Aster to analyze and discover patterns through nPath analysis <B>Hadoop</B> for loading, storing and 
refining data and optimizing storage costs
