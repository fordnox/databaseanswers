<B><BR>The Draft Business Rules have been defined and are listed below.</B>
<PRE><FONT COLOR=blue FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><B>A. The Area being Modelled is :-</B>
Inventory Control for a Retail outlet, such as a Health Food Store.

Here is the <B>Statement of User Requirements</B>, provided by John.

I looked at your 200 Data Models, and I thought that the <B>Department Store</B> database 
would be a good start but then the <B>Cosmetics Home Sales</B> looked good as well, also 
the <B>Inventory Control</B> looks relevant, but then I got very mixed up and I would like 
to see if you can help me.
I would like to put my inventory (I own a small health food store) in
a database, that I will be able to search by <B>Brand</B>, <B>Category</B> or <B>Vendor</B> etc..

Also I would like to be able to select an item and see from which <B>Vendors</B>
is available and at what cost.

I buy the same items from several <B>Vendors</B> and I would like to maintain
that information in an easy manner, also I get monthly special pricing
from my vendors that Iwould like to be able to see the cost.

All of the above I consider my <B>Vendor Catalogs</B> data.

At the same time I would like to have an area that I keep my store inventory 
and at the same time to be able to see the <B>Monthly Specials</B> and if I 
select an Items from my vendor a catalog to bring it into the store side of 
the inventory part.

Currently, I keep my vendor catalog in an Excel Spreadsheet and I have a 
drop down list, but it is very slow and not easy for every one in the store to use.

<B>B. The Things of Interest, ('THINGS'), include :-</B>
B.1 Items
B.2 Suppliers

<B>C. These THINGS are Related as follows :-</B>
C.1 An ITEM can be supplied by one or more SUPPLIER.
C.2 A SUPPLIER can supply zeor, one or many ITEMS.

<B>D. Other Characteristics of these THINGS include :-</B>
D.1 An ITEM has an Inventory Re-Order Quantity.

<B>E. Sample Data includes :-</B>
To be determined

<B>F. Typical Enquiries include :-</B>
F.1 How much Camomile Tea is in stock ?
F.2 How much Soya Milk do I order ?

<!---
G. DESIGN OPTIONS :
G.1 Handling Sub-Categories
       A general approach is to link the Table to itself. This allows flexible structures within the Products.
       A fixed approach is to have separate Tables for Categories and Sub-Categories.
	In this case, the general approach is recommended because change is likely to occur in the future.

G.1 Handling other Stuff associated with a PRODUCT :-
       A general approach like "Other Stuff" and "Other Stuff Type" or list them individually, 
       such as SECURITY_ISSUES, etc..

       It's better to spell out the other Stuff because it makes the Database easier to understand.
       Usually the maintenance involved is not an issue.

       Different kinds of other Stuff which may occur in the future should be handled by adding specific Tables,
       reflecting the structure of the other Stuff.
