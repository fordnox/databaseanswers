THE BROOKE EGYPT STRATEGIC REVIEW

<B>I. Context and rationale</B>
1.1 Context
The Brooke is a leading UK animal welfare charity dedicated to improving the lives of horses, donkeys and mules and the 
livelihoods of their owners working in the poorest parts of the world. 

There are an estimated 100 million working equine animals in the world and they are often the only source of income for 
many poor families, who depend on their working animal to survive. 
The Brooke – along with our partner organizations worldwide - supports mobile veterinary teams and community animal health workers who 
provide treatment to working animals and advice to their owners. 

Our community engagement specialists build the capacity of animal owners, local healers, farriers, saddlers, feed sellers, harness- and 
cart-makers to look after their animals’ needs in a sustainable way. 

We currently operate across 10 countries in Asia, Africa, Central America and the Middle East. 
We have over 800 staff working directly in the field. 

The Brooke’s mission is to do whatever will most improve the welfare of working horses, donkeys and mules through the alleviation of 
existing suffering and the development of equine welfare practices and facilities to prevent and reduce suffering in the future. 

In 2009 we reached 730,000 working horses and donkeys - benefiting over 3.7 million poor people who depend on them. 
The Brooke’s five years goal is to measurably improve the welfare of at least two million of the working horses, donkeys and mules in 
the most need in the developing world.

<B>Brooke Egypt (BE)</B>
There are 1,202,000 equine animals working in Egypt as indicated by the official governmental census report of 2008. 
Most of the working equines across Egypt carry out a wide range of types of work under very difficult circumstances and are exposed to 
high risk of poor animal welfare. 

The majority is used for transportation of passengers such as tourist carts in Luxor, carrying loads such as domestic waste materials for
vulnerable communities like the Zabballin, and many thousands work in brick kilns, for example in Helwan near Cairo. 

The main welfare problems are overloading, beating, mutilation (mainly firing), dehydration, heat stress, lameness and hoof problems and contagious 
diseases such as equine influenza. Veterinary services are available through the local governmental veterinary clinics and private vet clinics. 
However many animal owners perceive accessibility to and affordability of or possibly need for veterinary services as a problem. 
The Brooke began in Egypt in 1934 and our work has expanded to help working animals in poor urban and rural communities across the country. 

The goal of Brooke Egypt is to reduce pain and suffering of working equines in Egypt, with an underlying objective to improve the welfare of 
working equines sustainably within Brooke Egypt’s operational area. 


Today, the Brooke has 30 community mobile veterinary clinical teams and a growing community animal health training programme. 
Apart from the original clinic in Cairo there are five other clinics. Alexandria was opened in 1961, Luxor in 1966, 
Aswan in 1988, Edfu in 1992, Mersah Matrouh in 2000 and in 2006 Brooke Egypt opened a base in the Nile Delta. 

The Brooke Egypt provided 313900  treatments last year and estimates it will reach a maximum of 100,500  working animals and animals’ users and carers this year.

<B>1.2 Rationale</B>
The Brooke international strategy, set within the 5 year organizational strategy, provides the framework for country programme development. 

Country programme strategies and annual action plans are developed within this framework, contributing to the strategic objectives of Brooke. 

In Brooke Egypt the attention of the programme and investment has been focused on providing free veterinary treatment through the static and mobile clinics. 

More recently, over the past 5 years, ad-hoc additional activities have been undertaken such as community engagement, working in partnership with CBOs and 
other local structures such as rural guides. Staff capacity has been built in the use of welfare assessment and research methodologies to measure whether 
animal welfare is improving. 

However external clinical audits and other informal reviews and processes have identified issues that need to be addressed systematically for reasons of 
animal welfare, for sound programming reasons and also because evidence suggests that the Brooke Egypt programme is out of alignment with the Brooke’s 
global strategic plan and framework. 

The objective in the Brooke Egypt log frame 2010/11 is sustainable improvement in the welfare of working equines in Brooke Egypt’s operational area. 

Reaching sustainable improvement requires long term planning and this review should form the basis for the strategic planning process. 
Also the current log frame refers to potential expansion to El-Sharkia governorate to increase the number of animals reached. 
A strategic review is required to give clear direction to the further development of the programme (including expansion), in line with
organizational strategy, and to ensure the new initiatives are built on current best practices. 

<B>II. Objective of the Review</B>
A strategic review of the Brooke Egypt programmes is planned, in order to look with the BE Board, CEO and senior staff at what BE achieves and delivers 
annually and assess how this contributes to achieving the Brooke’s global programme strategy (see below). 
The outcome of the review should enable the Brooke Egypt management team to conduct strategic planning for the Brooke Egypt and, where needed, adapt its 
programme to ensure that it is in line with the Brooke’s international strategic framework.

The strategic objectives of Brooke most relevant to the Brooke Egypt programme are: 
•	Strategic Objective 1: We will ensure that communities and service providers are enabled to improve and sustain optimal welfare for working 
        equine animals both in the short and long term.
•	Strategic Objective 2: We will significantly increase our impact on working equine animal welfare, within and beyond the geographical areas in 
        which we work, through influencing and collaborating with local, national and international institutions.
•	Strategic Objective 4: We will define and promote our brand with pride and passion, making it synonymous with evidence-based improvements in 
        equine welfare, thereby reinforcing our status as a leading authority on working equine issues.
•	Strategic Objective 5: We will develop an international organization with strong accountability, working effectively and making the best use of 
        knowledge, expertise and resources.

These Terms of Reference are for a programmatic review; an organizational review was conducted in 2009.

<B>III. Scope of the Review</B>
The Review will focus around four (4) programmatic themes, see figure below. 

These themes are derived from the Brooke’s strategic objectives and based on the <B>programmatic approaches</B> required to deliver programmes for 
sustainable improvement in welfare (as described in the Brooke’s international Policy Paper: Making a Sustainable Difference to Working Equine Welfare). 

Figure 1 Strategic review themes.
 

The initial step in reviewing each theme is to identify what is currently done, how far this corresponds with what has been planned and what is achieved 
and delivered annually. 

The main part of the review will consist of an assessment of the effectiveness and efficiency of the approaches in Brooke Egypt to deliver a sustainable 
improvement in the welfare in line with the Brooke’s international strategic objectives and policies. 

The review should identify the gaps, explore options for more effective and efficient ways of working and make recommendations for each theme to be used 
as a basis for strategic planning. 


The Review should address the following questions:
<B>THEME 1 SUSTAINABLE SERVICE PROVISION</B>
•	What animal welfare service provision interventions are currently implemented in the field by the Brooke and how far do these correspond with what has been planned?
•	How effective and efficient is/are the current programme delivery approach(es) to provide veterinary and related services, such as farriery, by Brooke Egypt?  
        Are they working optimally? If not, what options can be explored to improve?
•	Are the range of veterinary, health related and other service providers clearly identified? How effective and efficient are they in delivering Accessibility, 
        Availability, Affordability, Acceptability and Quality (4 As and Q) services to working animals and their owners, users and carers?
•	How effective and efficient is/are the programm(es) in providing sustainable animal welfare services through capacity building of other service providers (4As and Q)?

<B>THEME 2 ENABLING COMMUNITIES TO IMPROVE AND MAINTAIN GOOD ANIMAL WELFARE</B>
•	What situational analysis has been done and what understanding do BE staff have of the animal owners and the animal owning communities?
•	What community engagement interventions are currently implemented in the field by Brooke Egypt and how far do these correspond with what has been planned? 
•	How effective and efficient are the current approaches for programme delivery in changing human behaviour to achieve motivated and knowledgeable owners, users and 
        carers who can improve and sustain good welfare in their working animals?
•	What systems are being built or supported by the programme to ensure sustainability of welfare improvement by the community in the long term; for example creation of 
        groups of animal owners to work together, and establishment of owner-led welfare monitoring systems?
•	Are the communities effectively linked with the service providers in Theme 1, both in the short and long term?

<B>THEME 3 EXPANSION, INFLUENCING AND COLLABORATION</B> 
•	How far has the past expansion targeted the neediest animals of the poorest communities (assessment of the decision-making process around expansion)? 
•	How far has expansion in the past contributed to a strategic development of the programme? What is the added value gained in replication of the regular work, albeit on 
        a larger scale? 
•	Are the collaborations/partnerships leading to, feeding into and/or adding value to the programme approaches to achieve sustainable improvement in animal welfare 
        (enabling communities and/or sustainable service delivery) and if so, how is this done?
•	How far is the wider enabling environment being influenced effectively and efficiently to achieve sustainable improvement of working equine welfare?

<B>THEME 4 MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES</B> 
•	What is Brooke Egypt’s understanding of the external environment and its impact on working equines? How has this understanding been used to inform programming and 
        resource allocation decisions in order to ensure that the programme being implemented is the right one and will contribute to achieving the greatest impact?
•	What are the current systems for project and programme planning, management and implementation? How well are they used and how effective are they in managing 
        implementation and making/informing management and resource allocation decisions?
•	How well are the current staff resources deployed managed and used to develop and implement programmes for working equine welfare improvement?
•	What M&E systems/frameworks exist? How are these used and how effective are they in enabling the monitoring implementation and gauging impact? 
•	What is the role of research in the Brooke Egypt programme? How does it contribute to achieving the organizational objectives? 
        How have the findings of research - past and current – been used to inform programme work?
•	What structures and systems are in place to adhere to the organizational minimum standards, on welfare, partnership and research?

<B>IV. REVIEW PROCESS & METHODOLOGY</B>
