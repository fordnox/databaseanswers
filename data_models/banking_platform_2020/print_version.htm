There was a very thought-provoking article by <B>Martin Wolf</B> in the 
<A HREF=http://www.ft.com/home/uk" TARGET=_NEW>Financial Times newspaper</A> for March 11th. 2016 entitled 
"Good news – fintech could disrupt finance”.

It states “Banking is currently inefficient, costly and riddled with conflicts of interest”.

It identifies three possible sources of disruption :
1.<B>Payments</B> Transformation, with one possibility being real-time settlements via 
   distributed ledgers.

2.<B>Peer-to-peer Lending</B>, in which new platforms disintermediate the traditional 
  businesses in matching savers with investments.

3.<B>Big Data</B> – “this might transform the quality of lending, which would be a good 
  thing. But the most striking effects are likely to be felt in insurance. With new 
  monitoring devices, insurers might gain direct knowledge of the quality of driving or 
  of the state of the clients’ health”.   

Our new Banking Data Platform reflects this article.</PRE>
