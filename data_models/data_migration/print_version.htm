<B>Design Patterns in Data Migration</B>
<BR>This page starts with the suggestion that Data Models are 'A Good Thing' and you can never have too much of 'A Good Thing'
<BR>Therefore, if the answer to everything is a Data Model then what exactly are the Questions ?

<BR>
<BR>We propose that an End-to-End range of Data Models provides a robust and generalised foundation for any 
Data Migration activity.
<BR>Of course, we consider it is true that 'Data Migration' is a deceptively simple way of describing the activities 
that occupy most of our waking (or working) hours most of the time.
<BR>This is appropriate whether we are Data Architects, Data Modellers or Data Analysts, 
where each role has a different range of skills and responbsibilities.

<BR>We start with Operational Data Stores and end with a Dimensional Model that feeds data for a BI Layer.

<BR><BR>Our question then becomes :-
<BR>What kind of Data Models do we need to cover our End-to-End Scope ?
 
<BR><BR>
We propose a range from ODS, Data Mapping, Data Warehouse, Dimensional Models and Semantic Models

<BR><BR>This seems a modest ambition, so let's discuss it in detail to see if it holds up under detailed analysis.

<TABLE BORDER=1><TR>
<TD VALIGN=top><ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR=blue FACE=Verdana SIZE=2>This page shows <B>four Design Patterns in Data Migration</B>.
<BR><BR><B>1) The first Design Pattern</B> shows Semantic Data Models which provide a 'User Friendly' front-end.
<BR>This helps Users to request KPIs, Reports and analyses using words and terminology that they normally use. 
<BR>For example, talking about Customers, rather than Parties.

<BR>If Semantic Data Models have been created, then we can say that the work has been done to the established standards of Best Practice.

<BR><B>2) The second Design Pattern</B> shows Mapping Specifications which translate Source data to Target data.

<HR><B>3) The third Design Pattern</B> identifies KPIs, and traces their derivation.
<BR>This helps to establish the Data Lineage for Sarbanes-Oxley and other Statutory Reporting requirements.

<HR>
<B>4) The fourth Design Pattern</B> shows the complete End-to-End scope of Data Models.
<BR>The <A HREF="../canonical_data_models/common_data_model.htm">Common Data Model</A> is used to standardise data that is loaded into the Data Warehouse (DWH).
<BR>We can also be sure that we have a 'Single View of the Truth' at any point in time.
<BR>It helps us to build the design of the DWH in a step-by-step fashion.
<BR><BR>We identify that the Enterprise Data Warehouse is a top-level design which will have lower-level <B>Subject Area Models</B> such as Customer Purchases.

<BR>Finally, we show the complete <B>Data Warehouse Bus Architecture</B>
