Note that Entities are shown in <B>Bold</B>.

1. Read Question:
Subject: Theater Bookings
Question: The ABC Theatre is a family theatre situated in a small town. 
The theatre stages plays, dance, and musical productions. 
It is also used for <B>presentations</B> associated with various local youth cricket, football, and rugby teams. 

The theatre treats presentations as a type of <B>production</B>. 
The theatre has made a healthy profit over the last five years and is now in a 
position to finance the development of a computerised booking system. 

The proposed booking system will manage <B>seat bookings</B> including the printing of 
<B>tickets</B> and production schedules as required. 

The proposed booking system should be operational by the end of September 2013. 
Information Required :-
Each production (see Figure 1 in the Appendix) may have one or more <B>performances</B>. 
A production is classified by one of the following <B>types</B> – 
Dance, Music, Play, and Presentation. 

Seating in the theatre (see Figure 2 in the Appendix) is arranged into three <B>groups 
of seats</B> as follows: 
<LI>Front block Rows A – J Seats 1 – 40 
<LI>Middle block Rows A – L Seats 1 – 50 
<LI>Back block Rows A – N Seats 1 – 60 

The <B>price classifications</B> for seats in the theatre are: 
<LI>Back block Rows H – N b Back block Rows A – G c 
<LI>Middle block Rows A – L d 
<LI>Front block Rows A – J 

For any particular production the price of a seat is the same for all performances. 
A <B>customer</B> can book tickets (see Figure 3 in the Appendix) either by telephone, in 
person or by post. 

If a customer books tickets in person, they will obviously collect their tickets at 
the time of booking. 

Customers who book by phone or post can either have the tickets sent to them or can 
collect them from the booking office. 
Before each performance, the theatre <B>staff</B> will need to print the tickets for those 
customers who opted to collect their tickets at the performance. 

After each production, the theatre <B>manager</B> will need a summary of ticket sales detailing 
the <B>income</B> from ticket sales, the value of <B>concessions</B> and the number of unsold seats. 

Regular customers can benefit by applying for membership of the theatre (see Figure 4 in 
the Appendix).
