<B>Subject Area for Billing</B>

<BR><BR>Billing is in a Subject Area of its own for two reasons :-
<BR>1) Billing is all derived data and therefore, accoring to the Rules, should not appear in a normalised Relational Data Base.
<BR>2) Details of Billing are not appropriate at the Top-Level Data Model.
