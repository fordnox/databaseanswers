<B>Business Rules</B>

<BR><BR>We have drafted these Business Rules and created the Data Model accordingly.
<BR>Then we discuss these Rules with business users and modify the Data Model accordingly.
<BR>1. Customers (who can be Departments) ask for Jobs to be done.
<BR>2. Equipment is involved in each Job.
<BR>3. Staff, such as Engineers, are also involved in each Job.
<BR>4. Documentation, such as Receipts and Work Orders, is used with each Job.
<BR>5. Payments are made for each Job. These can be transfers of money between Departments.
