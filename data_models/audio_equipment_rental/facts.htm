Subject: hiring equipment

Question: i need to create a conceptual data model based on this scenario.. 
but im a little stuck :( can u help?? 

SonicLive is a UK company that is specialised in hiring out audio equipment to 
recording artists to be used for the recording, mixing and mastering of music projects such 
as music tracks and albums. 

The company is based on 12 recording studios located all over the UK, including 4 in London. 

SonicLife offers a really wide range of studio equipment to their customers such as analogue 
and digital recorders, mixing desks, audio interfaces, microphones, studio monitors, digital 
converters, controllers and other miscellaneous studio accessories. 

The members of staff, who work in the SonicLive studios, include studio managers, drivers and 
sound engineers but some members of staff can be allocated to more than one studio. 

Every studio is assigned a studio manager. 
The role of the studio manager is to ensure the smooth day-to-day running of the studio that 
he/she is responsible for. 

The job of the drivers is to guarantee the safe transportation of equipment and for this purpose 
each driver is given a van and these vans are under the responsibility of the drivers they are 
given to and not shared among drivers. 

A record of which piece of equipment is transported by which driver needs to be kept. 

It is to be observed that vans can be out of service for certain periods of time, sometimes for 
quite a while, and are thus not used by any drivers during these times. 

The role of the sound engineers is to ensure that customers are provided with the right type of 
equipment for the music work that they want to do and that they can use it appropriately to get 
the best value out of it. 

Each engineer oversees a certain number of customers so that to ensure that all the customers 
have a first point-of-call in case they have any problems and thus to make sure that they receive 
the best possible customer service at all times. 

In addition, each engineer is responsible for a certain number of pieces of equipment which they 
need to closely look after in order to make sure that they are in pristine condition. 

To this effect, all pieces of equipment must be maintained regularly. 

At regular intervals or on specific dates, all pieces of equipments need to be serviced by the 
sound engineers who know how to fix them or by a whole group of engineers in the case of particularly 
complex equipment such as, for instance, large mixing desks. 

Similarly, if a piece of equipment is faulty, it needs to be repaired urgently so that it can be made 
available to the customers as rapidly as possible. 

It is also important to note that a piece of equipment is registered under a specific studio’s name 
so that a record is kept of which studio is ultimately responsible for it. 

A distinction is made between two different types of equipment. 

There is equipment that is fixed, like large mixing desks, digital recorders or audio interfaces, 
in the way that this equipment cannot leave the studio because of the size and therefore can be used 
only in the studio under the guidance of a sound engineer. 

Other pieces of equipment like microphones, converters and other accessories are portable in the sense 
that they can be taken away by customers to be used anywhere. 

Because of the highly technical nature of the equipment offered by SonicLive, a customer needs to first 
place a request for any piece of equipment he/she is willing to hire. 

This request needs to specify the start date and the end date of the period of utilisation of a specific 
piece of equipment, the level of expertise the customer who is going to use it has and a description of 
the project for which this piece of equipment is going to be used. 

Once it has been submitted, a SonicLive sound engineer examines the request, finds out about the availability 
of the required piece of equipment for the required period of utilisation and decides whether to go ahead 
with hiring out this equipment or not. 

If the piece of equipment is portable, a Portable Equipment Hiring Agreement is drawn to record when the 
equipment is to be hired out to the customer, when it is due to be returned, the initial cost of the 
hiring, whether an additional insurance needs to be subscribed to and the total cost of the hiring 
including any additional insurance. If the piece of equipment is fixed, i.e. not portable, a Fixed Equipment 
Hiring Contract is produced to record which piece of equipment is to be used by which customer under the 
guidance of which engineer, as well as the start and end dates of this utilisation and the cost involved.</PRE>
