<A HREF="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_asset" TARGET=_NEW>
"A financial asset</A> is an intangible asset that derives value because of a contractual claim. 
 <BR>Examples include bank deposits, bonds, and stocks. 
 <BR>Financial assets are usually more liquid than tangible assets, such as land or real estate, and 
 are traded on financial markets.
 <BR>According to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), a financial asset is defined as one of the following:
 <LI>Cash or cash equivalent;
 <LI>Equity instruments of another entity;
 <LI>Contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from another entity or to exchange financial assets or financial 
 <br>liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially favourable to the entity;
 <LI>Contract that will or may be settled in the entity's own equity instruments and is either a non-derivative for which the 
 <BR>entity is or may be obliged to receive a variable number of the entity's own equity instruments, or a derivative that will 
 <BR>or may be settled other than by exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the 
 <BR>entity's own equity instruments
