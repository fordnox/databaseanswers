This page lists the Businss Rules that define the logic behind the Data Model.
They are produced by Carolyn and accepted by Barry so that they become a jointly agreed document that combines 
the Requirements (produced by Carolyn) and the Design (produced by Barry) that meets the Requirements.
   
<HR>This is the text of Carolyn's Email, of March 23rd. 2013 :- 
You are awesome!!  Luv u man!!
<LI>Students can attend many classes
<LI>They must attend all four sessions
<LI>Sometimes we have to schedule a make-up class
<LI>Once students go through the 4 week class (specifically – Preparing to Teach) – they can actually become a teacher/instructor
<LI>I thought I had found a database template that does the job for this, but of course it does not.  
<LI>The reports wouldn’t let me show how many peeps attended what class, but they did allow me to use that fabulous list with the 
    A – B – C phone directory. 
    Love it! 
    (IF YOU ARE INTERESTED, TAKE A LOOK AT THE STUDENT DATABASE TEMPLATE BY MICROSOFT ACCESS)  
    Love the forms in that database.

<LI>The instructors need to take classes to keep up and ensure they are teaching facts and not opinion. 
<LI>At month end – I need to submit a report to show who attended what classes and who graduated from student to instructor.
<LI>Each month my pastor recommends a “Book of the month”.  
    We want to offer that book to the first person to sign up for the new classes.  
    I will need to give a report at qtr and year end for what books were given away, 
    who got them and add a new list of books for the New Year.
<LI>So we track our teachers, classes, students, and winners.
<LI>One added feature – I watched DATAPIG and he shares how to set up the phone list which simply looks so cool.</PRE>
