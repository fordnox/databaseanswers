<A HREF="index.htm">Back to the Data Model</A> 

<PRE><FONT COLOR=blue FACE=Verdana SIZE=2><B>This is the Start of the User specification of the Requirements :-</B>

A Database is required to support an e-Portal for a Vehicle and Motoring Registration  authority which is based on Web Services. 

The Business Rules that establish the design of the Database are shown as BR.1,BR.2 and so on.
The Business Rules clarify how the Data Model and corresponding Database meet the requirements.
 
It is very important to think through the theory behind the Data Model because the it is very powerful although it is not very large or complex.

Defining the <B>steps in the licensing cycle</B> is a good 'exercise for the student'and it will depend on local procedures in any particular country.
Here in England, you apply for a Test, turn up on the data arranged, take the test and then either pass or fail.
If you fail, you can try again after 6 months, and if you pass you are issued with a Driving Licence.
At the procedure level, these are simply Services which are linked, and for any person (ie Customer) they become  
records in the Customer_Service_Requests table, which are also linked so that it's possible to track the series of Events.

<HR>
The organizational structure reflects the services that the Customer Portal has to perform.

The Organisation has four <B>Departments</B> :-
1) Licence Managment Department - services include new licence, issue, block . organize test, etc.
2) Finance Department - services include pay fee against licence application, pay fee against cars etc.
3) Car Registration Department - services include register cars, change registration, etc.
4) Customer Support Department.  


<B>BR.1 In the Database, Departments will be stored in the Departments Table.</B>

These 4 departments offer different <B>Services</B> for online customers :-
1) Driving Licences where the Customer goes to the Portal and makes an application for a Driving Licence.
   This involves :- 
         *  Theory test date reservation
         *  Practical test date reservation etc. 
           
<B>BR.2 In the Database, a Reservation is stored as a Customer Servce Request.
<BR>The date when a Reservation is requested will be stored as the 'date_request_made' field in the Services Table.
<BR>The date for a Reservation will be stored as the 'date_request_granted' field in the Services Table.</B>

Every Service has an associated Cost.

<B>BR.3 In the Database, the cost of each Service will be stored as a field in the Services Table.</B>

<B>BR.4 In the Database, the total cost accumulated for a Customer will be stored as a field in the Customer_Service_Requests Table.</B>


3) Car Registration is supported by a Web-based application :-        
         * Car registration etc....

4) customer suport is also supported by a web-based application :-
          * the person who will be on the seat responds to the cutomer by viewing his profile.              
       
<B>BR.5 In the Database, the available Services will be stored in the Services Table.</B>

<B>BR.6 When a Customer requests a Service, records are created in the Customer_Service_Requests Table.</B>

2) The Customer can pay Application Fee using the online payment system.         
         *  Pay a fee against license application 
         *  Pay a fee for car Registration

<B>BR.7 When a Customer makes a Payment, records are created in the Customer_Payments Table.</B>


<B>This is the end of the User specification of the Requirements.</B>

<!---
Students - This table holds information about the students attending a college. 
           Each student is given a unique identifier.

Staff - Holds information about the staff, 
        contains a unique identifier for each staff member

Assignments - Holds information about assignments, 
              has unique identifier for each assignment.

Courses - Holds information about courses, 
          has unique identifier for each course.

Progress - This holds information about each student's progress of each assignment. 
           This is also used by the staff to mark assignments, and used by the college intranet to 
           display to students which assignments are currently unfinished.

Many students can study on many courses. 
Many staff can teach on many courses. 
Each course contains many assignments.

Course=---=Students 
Course=---=Staff 
Course----=Assignments

So from the database we need to:
<LI>display new assignments for students (if any) that staff submit 
<LI>find out which course the student is studying, so we can direct the student to appropriate information 
<LI>display student names for a staff member for individual courses that that they study on, as well as all courses 
<LI>and also some other minor queries.


<B>A. The Things of Interest include :-</B>
A.1 Courses Offered 
A.2 Courses Scheduled
A.3 Semesters
A.4 Staff

<B>B. How are they related ?</B>
B.1 An Assignment is associated with one, and only one, Scheduled Course.
B.2 A Scheduled Course has a defined start and end date.
