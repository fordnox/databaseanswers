<B>DATA  MODEL   FOR   TRANSACTIONS AUDIT TRAIL</B>

<HR>Here is Jim's Question :-
<PRE><FONT COLOR=blue FACE=Verdana SIZE=2>
Hi Barry,
 
I just stumbled upon your site.  

I am a fellow data modeler and am truly impressed with what you have posted there.
 
I have a question for you.  

I searched your site for "bitemporal", "temporal", etc. and didn't see anything.  

Your transaction model within Investment Banking is similar to what is often implemented, 
but for auditing purposes, many firms need the model to account for "As Of" or "Post-dated" 
corrections, such that one could answer both the questions that are posed on May 15:
"What were the transactions for account xyz in April, including what's been corrected from May 1 through today" 
and 
"What would you have told me the transactions for account xyz were in April, if you queried the database on May 1?".  

Have you had any experiences in this area (using dimensional data models) and discovered best practices that please 
data modelers, developers, business users, and auditors?
 
Best regards from across the pond,

Jim Lipner</PRE>
