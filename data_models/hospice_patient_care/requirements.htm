<B>Requirements ...</B><PRE><FONT COLOR=blue FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>The Database will contain records for each individual patient. 
As well as personal details such as name, address and next of kin, 
the patient record contains a brief summary of their condition, and 
personal notes, e.g. about diet and cultural preferences. 
Because patients may be admitted many times, a separate admissions file is 
required with records for each patient admission, with attributes such as 
admission date, discharge date, admission reason and discharge reason. 

Once patients are admitted to the hospice, they will be assessed regularly. 
The date and time of the assessment are recorded, along with a description 
of the patient’s symptoms. 

Each assessment may have one or more treatments associated with it. 
A treatment has a number of attributes, including a description, reason, and status.

Each assessment and each treatment is carried out by one health professional. 
Because holistic, multi-disciplinary care is provided, a speciality for each 
health professional is recorded (e.g. doctor, physiotherapist)."
