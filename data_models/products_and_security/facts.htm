The Draft FACTS</A> have been defined and are listed below ...
<PRE><FONT COLOR=blue FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>
A. The Area being Modelled is :-
An Online Product Catalogue for a Corporate Intranet.

B. The Things of Interest, ('THINGS'), include :-
B.1 Products
B.2 Product Accessories
B.3 Product Categories
B.4 Product Sub-Categories
B.5 Security Issues
B.6 Suppliers

C. These THINGS are Related as follows :-
C.1 A PRODUCT can have zero or many PRODUCT_ACCESSORIES.
C.2 A PRODUCT can be supplied by one or more SUPPLIERS.
C.3 A SUPPLIER can supply one or more PRODUCTS.
C.4 A PRODUCT_ACCESSORY can also, but not necessarily, be a PRODUCT.
C.5 A PRODUCT_ACCESSORY has exactly the same characteristics as a PRODUCT.
C.6 A PRODUCT can be in one and only one PRODUCT_CATEGORY.
C.7 A PRODUCT_CATEGORY can have zero or many PRODUCT_SUB_CATEGORIES.
C.8 A PRODUCT_SUB_CATEGORY can belong to one and only one PRODUCT_CATEGORY.

D. Other Characteristics of these THINGS include
D.1 A PRODUCT has a PRICE 
D.2 A PRODUCT can have zero or one PRODUCT_PICTURE.

E. Sample Data includes :-
To be determined

F. Typical Enquiries include :-
F.1 What ACCESSORIES are associated with a Telephone ?
F.2 What Sub-Categories exist for a Telephone ?

G. DESIGN OPTIONS :
G.1 Handling Sub-Categories
       A general approach is to link the Table to itself. This allows flexible structures within the Products.
       A fixed approach is to have separate Tables for Categories and Sub-Categories.
	In this case, the general approach is recommended because change is likely to occur in the future.

G.1 Handling other Stuff associated with a PRODUCT :-
       A general approach like "Other Stuff" and "Other Stuff Type" or list them individually, 
       such as SECURITY_ISSUES, etc..

       It's better to spell out the other Stuff because it makes the Database easier to understand.
       Usually the maintenance involved is not an issue.

       Different kinds of other Stuff which may occur in the future should be handled by adding specific Tables,
       reflecting the structure of the other Stuff.

Not all Categories have sub categories, for example PalmPilot.
Some Category, (e.g. phones and accessories), have many sub categories 
(desk phones, cell phones, voice mail, calling cards and so on).
