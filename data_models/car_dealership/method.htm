The first cut for <B>the Data Model</B> is shown below, and becomes the Database design.
<P>This Structured <B>Method</B> is a general approach</B> to <B>establish the FACTS</B> :-
<FONT SIZE=2>
<BR>1) Define the Area of Interest,(e.g. Car Sales).
<BR>2) Define the "Things of Interest",(e.g. Cars), in the Area of Interest.
<BR>3) Analyze the Things of Interest and identify the corresponding Tables. 
<BR>4) Establish the relationships between the Tables. 
<BR>5) Determine the characteristics of each Table,(e.g. a Car has a Manufacturer). 
<BR>6) Obtain a small set of Sample Data.
<BR>7) Confirm the first draft of the Database design against the Sample Data.
<BR>8) Obtain from the users some representative enquiries for the Database.
<BR>9) Review the Results of Steps 1) to 8) with appropriate people, such as Users, Managers, 
<BR>Development staff, etc. and repeat until the final Database design is reached.

<HR>

<B>Things of Interest in this Area are shown as Entities in the diagram :-</B>
<LI>Cars, Car Manufacturers, Customers, etc..

<PRE><FONT COLOR=blue FACE=Verdana SIZE=2>Here is user's proposed design :
We are a car dealership with a few branch car lots in different part of the state(or city).

We have a few dozen cars of variety(new, used, all brands) in stock.

We are doing a online inventory database to attract and inform customers. 
It will allow users to access all our vehicles that are for sell, and view related information like detail, location, contact person.

I have 4 proposed entities right now:
-VEHICLE     : physical descriptions about a vehicle
-INVENTORY   : vehicle available for sale, its branch location, and the salesperson to contact.
-SALESPERSON : contact info, and the branch the person belong.
-BRANCH      : location, contact info.

Please give me your comments. I'd really like to go on to the next step some time.
</PRE>
