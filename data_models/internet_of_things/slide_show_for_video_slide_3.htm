<TD ALIGN=left VALIGN=top><FONT COLOR=blue FACE=Verdana SIZE=2><B>Slide 1 - The Problem</B>
<BR><PRE><FONT COLOR=blue FACE=Verdana SIZE=2>Hello and Welcome.
My name is Barry Williams and I am the Founder and 
Principal Consultant with Database Answers.

<B>The Problem</B>
The Internet of Things is attracting a lot of interest from 
a wide range of organisations.

This is generating many diverse approaches to IoT and creating 
the problem of integrating these approaches.

<TD ALIGN=left VALIGN=top><PRE><FONT COLOR=blue FACE=Verdana SIZE=2><B>Slide 2 - The Solution</B>

I have a unique solution to this problem, which 
is a Universal IoT Platform.

This Platform will be built on our Layered Data 
Architecture which is shown in this diagram.

<TD ALIGN=left VALIGN=top><PRE><FONT COLOR=blue FACE=Verdana SIZE=2><B>Slide 3 - Development Plan</B>

My Development plan is to build Platforms for 
Industry-specific Applications  as shown here and 
then integrate them into the overall IoT Platform.

<TD ALIGN=left VALIGN=top><PRE><FONT COLOR=blue FACE=Verdana SIZE=2><B>Slide 4 - Marketing</B>
<BR>Our Platform is being built with Oracle’s 
Cloud-based Data-as-a-Service and our current 
thinking about marketing is to work with Oracle 
and Oracle Partners. 

Oracle is very keen to be dominant in the Clouds 
and their Partners will include those with a special 
interest in IoT who have a knowledge of the marketplace.

in the Forensics book, Anthropology is called <B>"The Science of&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<BR>Bones"</B>
<BR><BR>In other words, the Evidence is predominantly Bones, the 
<BR>Analysis involves tests and techniques that are appropriate 
<BR>to Bones and the Analysis is the identification of an individual 
<BR>human being from the evidence of Bones.
<BR><BR>
A number of <B>Participants</B> play different <B>Roles</B> including 
<BR>anthropologists, X-ray technicians and photographers.
<BR>Work took place at a  number of <B>Locations</B>, including murder 
<BR>sites, laboratories and courts.

<BR>A variety of <B>Documents</B> is involved, such as Reports of 
<BR>Findings, Court Proceedings and Publications. 
<BR><BR>A wide range of activities is involved, which we can classify as 
<BR><B>Events</B>.
