--->

<B>G. Design Notes :-</B>
<!---
G.1 The proposed design can easily be implemented with either one Rental Item Table
or separate Tables for Videos, Games, etc.. 

However, a VIDEOS Table will be preferred if there are many data items are specific
to VIDEOS, and it's often better to avoid an approach which is designed to provide 
generality at the expense of ease of understanding.

    The 'zero' option provides flexibility where a CUSTOMER calls 
    to place an ORDER for a RENTAL_ITEM, which is subsequently cancelled.
C.2 A CUSTOMER can place zero or many ORDERS for RENTAL_ITEMS.
C.3 A CUSTOMER_ORDER must always be associated with one and only one CUSTOMER.
C.4 A CUSTOMER_RENTAL must always be associated with one and only one CUSTOMER.
C.5 All RENTAL_ITEMS have many attributes in common, and (maybe) some which are not common.
